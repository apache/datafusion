# Custom Table Provider

Like other areas of DataFusion, you extend DataFusion's functionality by implementing a trait. The `TableProvider` and associated traits, have methods that allow you to implement a custom table provider, i.e. use DataFusion's other functionality with your custom data source.

This section will also touch on how to have DataFusion use the new `TableProvider` implementation.

## Table Provider and Scan

The `scan` method on the `TableProvider` is likely its most important. It returns an `ExecutionPlan` that DataFusion will use to read the actual data during execution of the query.

### Scan

As mentioned, `scan` returns an execution plan, and in particular a `Result<Arc<dyn ExecutionPlan>>`. The core of this is returning something that can be dynamically dispatched to an `ExecutionPlan`. And as per the general DataFusion idea, we'll need to implement it.

#### Execution Plan

The `ExecutionPlan` trait at its core is a way to get a stream of batches. The aptly-named `execute` method returns a `Result<SendableRecordBatchStream>`, which should be a stream of `RecordBatch`es that can be sent across threads, and has a schema that matches the data to be contained in those batches.

There are many different types of `SendableRecordBatchStream` implemented in DataFusion -- you can use a pre existing one, such as `MemoryStream` (if your `RecordBatch`es are all in memory) or implement your own custom logic, depending on your usecase.

Looking at the full example below:

```rust
use std::any::Any;
use std::sync::{Arc, Mutex};
use std::collections::{BTreeMap, HashMap};
use datafusion::common::Result;
use datafusion::arrow::datatypes::{DataType, Field, Schema, SchemaRef};
use datafusion::physical_plan::expressions::PhysicalSortExpr;
use datafusion::physical_plan::{
    ExecutionPlan, SendableRecordBatchStream, DisplayAs, DisplayFormatType,
    Statistics, PlanProperties
};
use datafusion::execution::context::TaskContext;
use datafusion::arrow::array::{UInt64Builder, UInt8Builder};
use datafusion::physical_plan::memory::MemoryStream;
use datafusion::arrow::record_batch::RecordBatch;

/// A User, with an id and a bank account
#[derive(Clone, Debug)]
struct User {
    id: u8,
    bank_account: u64,
}

/// A custom datasource, used to represent a datastore with a single index
#[derive(Clone, Debug)]
pub struct CustomDataSource {
    inner: Arc<Mutex<CustomDataSourceInner>>,
}

#[derive(Debug)]
struct CustomDataSourceInner {
    data: HashMap<u8, User>,
    bank_account_index: BTreeMap<u64, u8>,
}

#[derive(Debug)]
struct CustomExec {
    db: CustomDataSource,
    projected_schema: SchemaRef,
}

impl DisplayAs for CustomExec {
    fn fmt_as(&self, _t: DisplayFormatType, f: &mut std::fmt::Formatter) -> std::fmt::Result {
        write!(f, "CustomExec")
    }
}

impl ExecutionPlan for CustomExec {
    fn name(&self) -> &str {
        "CustomExec"
    }

    fn as_any(&self) -> &dyn Any {
        self
    }

    fn schema(&self) -> SchemaRef {
        self.projected_schema.clone()
    }


    fn properties(&self) -> &PlanProperties {
        unreachable!()
    }

    fn children(&self) -> Vec<&Arc<dyn ExecutionPlan>> {
        Vec::new()
    }

    fn with_new_children(
        self: Arc<Self>,
        _: Vec<Arc<dyn ExecutionPlan>>,
    ) -> Result<Arc<dyn ExecutionPlan>> {
        Ok(self)
    }

    fn execute(
        &self,
        _partition: usize,
        _context: Arc<TaskContext>,
    ) -> Result<SendableRecordBatchStream> {
        let users: Vec<User> = {
            let db = self.db.inner.lock().unwrap();
            db.data.values().cloned().collect()
        };

        let mut id_array = UInt8Builder::with_capacity(users.len());
        let mut account_array = UInt64Builder::with_capacity(users.len());

        for user in users {
            id_array.append_value(user.id);
            account_array.append_value(user.bank_account);
        }

        Ok(Box::pin(MemoryStream::try_new(
            vec![RecordBatch::try_new(
                self.projected_schema.clone(),
                vec![
                    Arc::new(id_array.finish()),
                    Arc::new(account_array.finish()),
                ],
            )?],
            self.schema(),
            None,
        )?))
    }
}
```

This `execute` method:

1. Gets the users from the database
2. Constructs the individual output arrays (columns)
3. Returns a `MemoryStream` of a single `RecordBatch` with the arrays

I.e. returns the "physical" data. For other examples, refer to the [`CsvSource`][csv] and [`ParquetSource`][parquet] for more complex implementations.

With the `ExecutionPlan` implemented, we can now implement the `scan` method of the `TableProvider`.

#### Scan Revisited

The `scan` method of the `TableProvider` returns a `Result<Arc<dyn ExecutionPlan>>`. We can use the `Arc` to return a reference-counted pointer to the `ExecutionPlan` we implemented. In the example, this is done by:

```rust

use async_trait::async_trait;
use datafusion::logical_expr::expr::Expr;
use datafusion::datasource::{TableProvider, TableType};
use datafusion::physical_plan::project_schema;
use datafusion::catalog::Session;

impl CustomExec {
    fn new(
        projections: Option<&Vec<usize>>,
        schema: SchemaRef,
        db: CustomDataSource,
    ) -> Self {
        let projected_schema = project_schema(&schema, projections).unwrap();
        Self {
            db,
            projected_schema,
        }
    }
}

impl CustomDataSource {
    pub(crate) async fn create_physical_plan(
        &self,
        projections: Option<&Vec<usize>>,
        schema: SchemaRef,
    ) -> Result<Arc<dyn ExecutionPlan>> {
        Ok(Arc::new(CustomExec::new(projections, schema, self.clone())))
    }
}

#[async_trait]
impl TableProvider for CustomDataSource {
    fn as_any(&self) -> &dyn Any {
        self
    }

    fn schema(&self) -> SchemaRef {
        SchemaRef::new(Schema::new(vec![
            Field::new("id", DataType::UInt8, false),
            Field::new("bank_account", DataType::UInt64, true),
        ]))
    }

    fn table_type(&self) -> TableType {
        TableType::Base
    }

    async fn scan(
        &self,
        _state: &dyn Session,
        projection: Option<&Vec<usize>>,
        // filters and limit can be used here to inject some push-down operations if needed
        _filters: &[Expr],
        _limit: Option<usize>,
    ) -> Result<Arc<dyn ExecutionPlan>> {
        return self.create_physical_plan(projection, self.schema()).await;
    }
}
```

With this, and the implementation of the omitted methods, we can now use the `CustomDataSource` as a `TableProvider` in DataFusion.

##### Additional `TableProvider` Methods

`scan` has no default implementation, so it needed to be written. There are other methods on the `TableProvider` that have default implementations, but can be overridden if needed to provide additional functionality.

###### `supports_filters_pushdown`

The `supports_filters_pushdown` method can be overridden to indicate which filter expressions support being pushed down to the data source and within that the specificity of the pushdown.

This returns a `Vec` of `TableProviderFilterPushDown` enums where each enum represents a filter that can be pushed down. The `TableProviderFilterPushDown` enum has three variants:

- `TableProviderFilterPushDown::Unsupported` - the filter cannot be pushed down
- `TableProviderFilterPushDown::Exact` - the filter can be pushed down and the data source can guarantee that the filter will be applied completely to all rows. This is the highest performance option.
- `TableProviderFilterPushDown::Inexact` - the filter can be pushed down, but the data source cannot guarantee that the filter will be applied to all rows. DataFusion will apply `Inexact` filters again after the scan to ensure correctness.

For filters that can be pushed down, they'll be passed to the `scan` method as the `filters` parameter and they can be made use of there.

## Using the Custom Table Provider

In order to use the custom table provider, we need to register it with DataFusion. This is done by creating a `TableProvider` and registering it with the `SessionContext`.

This will allow you to use the custom table provider in DataFusion. For example, you could use it in a SQL query to get a `DataFrame`.

```rust


use datafusion::execution::context::SessionContext;

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() -> Result<()> {
    let ctx = SessionContext::new();

    let custom_table_provider = CustomDataSource {
        inner: Arc::new(Mutex::new(CustomDataSourceInner {
            data: Default::default(),
            bank_account_index: Default::default(),
        })),
    };

    ctx.register_table("customers", Arc::new(custom_table_provider));
    let df = ctx.sql("SELECT id, bank_account FROM customers").await?;

    Ok(())
}
```

## Recap

To recap, in order to implement a custom table provider, you need to:

1. Implement the `TableProvider` trait
2. Implement the `ExecutionPlan` trait
3. Register the `TableProvider` with the `SessionContext`

## Next Steps

As mentioned the [csv] and [parquet] implementations are good examples of how to implement a `TableProvider`. The [example in this repo][ex] is a good example of how to implement a `TableProvider` that uses a custom data source.

More abstractly, see the following traits for more information on how to implement a custom `TableProvider` for a file format:

- `FileOpener` - a trait for opening a file and inferring the schema
- `FileFormat` - a trait for reading a file format
- `ListingTableProvider` - a useful trait for implementing a `TableProvider` that lists files in a directory
