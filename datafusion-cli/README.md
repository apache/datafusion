# DataFusion Command-line Interface

[DataFusion](https://datafusion.apache.org/) is an extensible query execution framework, written in Rust, that uses Apache Arrow as its in-memory format.

DataFusion CLI (`datafusion-cli`) is a small command line utility that runs SQL queries using the DataFusion engine.

# Frequently Asked Questions

## Where can I find more information?

See the [`datafusion-cli` documentation](https://datafusion.apache.org/user-guide/cli/index.html) for further information.

## Memory Profiling

Enable memory tracking for the next query and display the report afterwards:

```text
> \memory_profiling on
Memory profiling enabled for next query
> SELECT v % 100 AS group_key, COUNT(*) AS cnt, SUM(v) AS sum_v  FROM generate_series(1,100000) AS t(v)  GROUP BY group_key  ORDER BY group_key;

+-----------+------+----------+
| group_key | cnt  | sum_v    |
+-----------+------+----------+
| 0         | 1000 | 50050000 |
| 1         | 1000 | 49951000 |
| 2         | 1000 | 49952000 |
