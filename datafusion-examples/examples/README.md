# DataFusion Examples

## Single Process

The examples `csv_sql.rs` and `parquet_sql.rs` demonstrate building a query plan from a SQL statement and then executing the query plan against local CSV and Parquet files, respectively.

## Distributed

The `flight-client.rs` and `flight-server.rs` examples demonstrate how to run DataFusion as a standalone process and execute SQL queries from a client using the Flight protocol.
