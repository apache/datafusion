//! This example demonstrates how to use TrackConsumersPool for memory tracking and debugging.
//!
//! The TrackConsumersPool provides enhanced error messages that show the top memory consumers
//! when memory allocation fails, making it easier to debug memory issues in DataFusion queries.
//!
//! # Examples
