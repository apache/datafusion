# DataFusion Benchmarks

This crate contains benchmarks based on popular public data sets and open source benchmark suites, making it easy to
run real-world benchmarks to help with performance and scalability testing and for comparing performance with other Arrow
implementations as well as other query engines.

## Benchmark derived from TPC-H

These benchmarks are derived from the [TPC-H][1] benchmark. And we use this repo as the source of tpch-gen and answers: 
https://github.com/databricks/tpch-dbgen.git, based on [2.17.1](https://www.tpc.org/tpc_documents_current_versions/pdf/tpc-h_v2.17.1.pdf) version of TPC-H.

## Generating Test Data

TPC-H data can be generated using the `tpch-gen.sh` script, which creates a Docker image containing the TPC-DS data
generator.

```bash
# scale_factor: scale of the database population. scale 1.0 represents ~1 GB of data
./tpch-gen.sh <scale_factor>
```

Data will be generated into the `data` subdirectory and will not be checked in because this directory has been added
to the `.gitignore` file.

## Running the DataFusion Benchmarks

The benchmark can then be run (assuming the data created from `dbgen` is in `./data`) with a command such as:

```bash
cargo run --release --bin tpch -- benchmark datafusion --iterations 3 --path ./data --format tbl --query 1 --batch-size 4096
```

You can enable the features `simd` (to use SIMD instructions, `cargo nightly` is required.) and/or `mimalloc` or `snmalloc` (to use either the mimalloc or snmalloc allocator) as features by passing them in as `--features`:

```
cargo run --release --features "simd mimalloc" --bin tpch -- benchmark datafusion --iterations 3 --path ./data --format tbl --query 1 --batch-size 4096
```

The benchmark program also supports CSV and Parquet input file formats and a utility is provided to convert from `tbl`
(generated by the `dbgen` utility) to CSV and Parquet.

```bash
cargo run --release --bin tpch -- convert --input ./data --output /mnt/tpch-parquet --format parquet
```

Or if you want to verify and run all the queries in the benchmark, you can just run `cargo test`.

## Expected output

The result of query 1 should produce the following output when executed against the SF=1 dataset.

## NYC Taxi Benchmark

These benchmarks are based on the [New York Taxi and Limousine Commission][2] data set.

```bash
cargo run --release --bin nyctaxi -- --iterations 3 --path /mnt/nyctaxi/csv --format csv --batch-size 4096
```

Example output:

```bash
Running benchmarks with the following options: Opt { debug: false, iterations: 3, batch_size: 4096, path: "/mnt/nyctaxi/csv", file_format: "csv" }
Executing 'fare_amt_by_passenger'
Query 'fare_amt_by_passenger' iteration 0 took 7138 ms
Query 'fare_amt_by_passenger' iteration 1 took 7599 ms
Query 'fare_amt_by_passenger' iteration 2 took 7969 ms
```

## h2o benchmarks

```bash
cargo run --release --bin h2o group-by --query 1 --path /mnt/bigdata/h2oai/N_1e7_K_1e2_single.csv --mem-table --debug
```

Example run:

```
Running benchmarks with the following options: GroupBy(GroupBy { query: 1, path: "/mnt/bigdata/h2oai/N_1e7_K_1e2_single.csv", debug: false })
