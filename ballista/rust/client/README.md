# Ballista: Distributed Scheduler for Apache Arrow DataFusion

Ballista is a distributed compute platform primarily implemented in Rust, and powered by Apache Arrow and
DataFusion. It is built on an architecture that allows other programming languages (such as Python, C++, and
Java) to be supported as first-class citizens without paying a penalty for serialization costs.

The foundational technologies in Ballista are:

- [Apache Arrow](https://arrow.apache.org/) memory model and compute kernels for efficient processing of data.
- [Apache Arrow Flight Protocol](https://arrow.apache.org/blog/2019/10/13/introducing-arrow-flight/) for efficient
  data transfer between processes.
- [Google Protocol Buffers](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers) for serializing query plans.
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) for packaging up executors along with user-defined code.

Ballista can be deployed as a standalone cluster and also supports [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/). In either
case, the scheduler can be configured to use [etcd](https://etcd.io/) as a backing store to (eventually) provide
redundancy in the case of a scheduler failing.

## Rust Version Compatbility

This crate is tested with the latest stable version of Rust. We do not currrently test against other, older versions of the Rust compiler.

## Starting a cluster

There are numerous ways to start a Ballista cluster, including support for Docker and
Kubernetes. For full documentation, refer to the
[DataFusion User Guide](https://arrow.apache.org/datafusion/user-guide/introduction.html)

A simple way to start a local cluster for testing purposes is to use cargo to install
the scheduler and executor crates.

```bash
cargo install ballista-scheduler
cargo install ballista-executor
```

With these crates installed, it is now possible to start a scheduler process.

```bash
RUST_LOG=info ballista-scheduler
```

The scheduler will bind to port 50050 by default.

Next, start an executor processes in a new terminal session with the specified concurrency
level.

```bash
RUST_LOG=info ballista-executor -c 4
```

The executor will bind to port 50051 by default. Additional executors can be started by
manually specifying a bind port. For example:

```bash
RUST_LOG=info ballista-executor --bind-port 50052 -c 4
```

## Executing a query

Ballista provides a `BallistaContext` as a starting point for creating queries. DataFrames can be created
by invoking the `read_csv`, `read_parquet`, and `sql` methods.

To build a simple ballista example, add the following dependencies to your `Cargo.toml` file:

```toml
[dependencies]
ballista = "0.6"
datafusion = "6.0"
tokio = "1.0"
```

The following example runs a simple aggregate SQL query against a CSV file from the
[New York Taxi and Limousine Commission](https://www1.nyc.gov/site/tlc/about/tlc-trip-record-data.page)
data set.

```rust,no_run
use ballista::prelude::*;
use datafusion::arrow::util::pretty;
use datafusion::prelude::CsvReadOptions;

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() -> Result<()> {
   // create configuration
   let config = BallistaConfig::builder()
       .set("ballista.shuffle.partitions", "4")
       .build()?;

   // connect to Ballista scheduler
   let ctx = BallistaContext::remote("localhost", 50050, &config);

   // register csv file with the execution context
   ctx.register_csv(
       "tripdata",
       "/path/to/yellow_tripdata_2020-01.csv",
       CsvReadOptions::new(),
   ).await?;

   // execute the query
   let df = ctx.sql(
       "SELECT passenger_count, MIN(fare_amount), MAX(fare_amount), AVG(fare_amount), SUM(fare_amount)
       FROM tripdata
       GROUP BY passenger_count
       ORDER BY passenger_count",
   ).await?;

   // collect the results and print them to stdout
   let results = df.collect().await?;
   pretty::print_batches(&results)?;
   Ok(())
}
```
