# Ballista: Distributed Compute with Apache Arrow

Ballista is a distributed compute platform primarily implemented in Rust, and powered by Apache Arrow. It is built
on an architecture that allows other programming languages (such as Python, C++, and Java) to be supported as
first-class citizens without paying a penalty for serialization costs.

The foundational technologies in Ballista are:

- [Apache Arrow](https://arrow.apache.org/) memory model and compute kernels for efficient processing of data.
- [Apache Arrow Flight Protocol](https://arrow.apache.org/blog/2019/10/13/introducing-arrow-flight/) for efficient
  data transfer between processes.
- [Google Protocol Buffers](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers) for serializing query plans.
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) for packaging up executors along with user-defined code.

Ballista can be deployed as a standalone cluster and also supports [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/). In either
case, the scheduler can be configured to use [etcd](https://etcd.io/) as a backing store to (eventually) provide
redundancy in the case of a scheduler failing.

# How does this compare to Apache Spark?

Although Ballista is largely inspired by Apache Spark, there are some key differences.

- The choice of Rust as the main execution language means that memory usage is deterministic and avoids the overhead of
  GC pauses.
- Ballista is designed from the ground up to use columnar data, enabling a number of efficiencies such as vectorized
  processing (SIMD and GPU) and efficient compression. Although Spark does have some columnar support, it is still
  largely row-based today.
- The combination of Rust and Arrow provides excellent memory efficiency and memory usage can be 5x - 10x lower than
  Apache Spark in some cases, which means that more processing can fit on a single node, reducing the overhead of
  distributed compute.
- The use of Apache Arrow as the memory model and network protocol means that data can be exchanged between executors
  in any programming language with minimal serialization overhead.

## Status

Ballista was [donated](https://arrow.apache.org/blog/2021/04/12/ballista-donation/) to the Apache Arrow project in
April 2021 and should be considered experimental.

## Getting Started

The [Ballista Developer Documentation](docs/README.md) and the
[DataFusion User Guide](https://github.com/apache/arrow-datafusion/tree/master/docs/user-guide) are currently the
best sources of information for getting started with Ballista.
