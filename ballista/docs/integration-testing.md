# Integration Testing

We use the [DataFusion Benchmarks](https://github.com/apache/arrow-datafusion/tree/master/benchmarks) for integration
testing.

The integration tests can be executed by running the following command from the root of the DataFusion repository.

```bash
./dev/integration-tests.sh
```
