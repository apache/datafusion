# Roadmap

The [project introduction](../user-guide/introduction) explains the
overview and goals of DataFusion, and our development efforts largely
align to that vision.

## Planning `EPIC`s

DataFusion uses [GitHub
issues](https://github.com/apache/arrow-datafusion/issues) to track
planned work. We collect related tickets using tracking issues labeled
with `[EPIC]` which contain discussion and links to more detailed items.

Epics offer a high level roadmap of what the DataFusion
community is thinking about. The epics are not meant to restrict
possibilities, but rather help the community see where development is
headed, align our work, and inspire additional contributions.

As this project is entirely driven by volunteers, we welcome
contributions for items not currently covered by epics. However,
before submitting a large PR, we strongly suggest and request you
start a conversation using a github issue or the
[dev@arrow.apache.org](mailto:dev@arrow.apache.org) mailing list to
make review efficient and avoid surprises.

[The current list of `EPIC`s can be found here](https://github.com/apache/arrow-datafusion/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+epic).
