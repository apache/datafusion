# Date

These SQL functions are specific to DataFusion, or they are well known and have functionality which is specific to DataFusion. Specifically, the `to_timestamp_xx()` functions exist due to Arrow's support for multiple timestamp resolutions.

## `to_timestamp`

`to_timestamp()` is similar to the standard SQL function. It performs conversions to type `Timestamp(Nanoseconds, None)`, from:

- Timestamp strings
    - `1997-01-31T09:26:56.123Z` # RCF3339
    - `1997-01-31T09:26:56.123-05:00` # RCF3339
    - `1997-01-31 09:26:56.123-05:00` # close to RCF3339 but with a space er than T
    - `1997-01-31T09:26:56.123` # close to RCF3339 but no timezone et specified
    - `1997-01-31 09:26:56.123` # close to RCF3339 but uses a space and timezone offset
    - `1997-01-31 09:26:56` # close to RCF3339, no fractional seconds
- An Int64 array/column, values are nanoseconds since Epoch UTC
- Other Timestamp() columns or values

Note that conversions from other Timestamp and Int64 types can also be performed using `CAST(.. AS Timestamp)`. However, the conversion functionality here is present for consistency with the other `to_timestamp_xx()` functions.

## `to_timestamp_millis`

`to_timestamp_millis()` does conversions to type `Timestamp(Milliseconds, None)`, from:

- Timestamp strings, the same as supported by the regular timestamp() function (except the output is a timestamp of Milliseconds resolution)
    - `1997-01-31T09:26:56.123Z` # RCF3339
    - `1997-01-31T09:26:56.123-05:00` # RCF3339
    - `1997-01-31 09:26:56.123-05:00` # close to RCF3339 but with a space er than T
    - `1997-01-31T09:26:56.123` # close to RCF3339 but no timezone et specified
    - `1997-01-31 09:26:56.123` # close to RCF3339 but uses a space and timezone offset
    - `1997-01-31 09:26:56` # close to RCF3339, no fractional seconds
- An Int64 array/column, values are milliseconds since Epoch UTC
- Other Timestamp() columns or values

Note that `CAST(.. AS Timestamp)` converts to Timestamps with Nanosecond resolution; this function is the only way to convert/cast to millisecond resolution.

## `to_timestamp_micros`

`to_timestamp_micros()` does conversions to type `Timestamp(Microseconds, None)`, from:

- Timestamp strings, the same as supported by the regular timestamp() function (except the output is a timestamp of microseconds resolution)
    - `1997-01-31T09:26:56.123Z` # RCF3339
    - `1997-01-31T09:26:56.123-05:00` # RCF3339
    - `1997-01-31 09:26:56.123-05:00` # close to RCF3339 but with a space er than T
    - `1997-01-31T09:26:56.123` # close to RCF3339 but no timezone et specified
    - `1997-01-31 09:26:56.123` # close to RCF3339 but uses a space and timezone offset
    - `1997-01-31 09:26:56` # close to RCF3339, no fractional seconds
- An Int64 array/column, values are microseconds since Epoch UTC
- Other Timestamp() columns or values

Note that `CAST(.. AS Timestamp)` converts to Timestamps with Nanosecond resolution; this function is the only way to convert/cast to microsecond resolution.

## `to_timestamp_seconds`

`to_timestamp_seconds()` does conversions to type `Timestamp(Seconds, None)`, from:

- Timestamp strings, the same as supported by the regular timestamp() function (except the output is a timestamp of secondseconds resolution)
    - `1997-01-31T09:26:56.123Z` # RCF3339
    - `1997-01-31T09:26:56.123-05:00` # RCF3339
    - `1997-01-31 09:26:56.123-05:00` # close to RCF3339 but with a space er than T
    - `1997-01-31T09:26:56.123` # close to RCF3339 but no timezone et specified
    - `1997-01-31 09:26:56.123` # close to RCF3339 but uses a space and timezone offset
    - `1997-01-31 09:26:56` # close to RCF3339, no fractional seconds
- An Int64 array/column, values are seconds since Epoch UTC
- Other Timestamp() columns or values

Note that `CAST(.. AS Timestamp)` converts to Timestamps with Nanosecond resolution; this function is the only way to convert/cast to seconds resolution.

## `extract`

`extract(field FROM source)`

- The `extract` function retrieves subfields such as year or hour from date/time values.
  `source` must be a value expression of type timestamp, Date32, or Date64. `field` is an identifier that selects what field to extract from the source value.
  The `extract` function returns values of type u32.
    - `year` :`extract(year FROM to_timestamp('2020-09-08T12:00:00+00:00')) -> 2020`
    - `month`:`extract(month FROM to_timestamp('2020-09-08T12:00:00+00:00')) -> 9`
    - `week` :`extract(week FROM to_timestamp('2020-09-08T12:00:00+00:00')) -> 37`
    - `day`: `extract(day FROM to_timestamp('2020-09-08T12:00:00+00:00')) -> 8`
    - `hour`: `extract(hour FROM to_timestamp('2020-09-08T12:00:00+00:00')) -> 12`
    - `minute`: `extract(minute FROM to_timestamp('2020-09-08T12:01:00+00:00')) -> 1`
    - `second`: `extract(second FROM to_timestamp('2020-09-08T12:00:03+00:00')) -> 3`

## `date_part`

`date_part('field', source)`

- The `date_part` function is modeled on the postgres equivalent to the SQL-standard function `extract`.
  Note that here the field parameter needs to be a string value, not a name.
  The valid field names for `date_part` are the same as for `extract`.
    - `date_part('second', to_timestamp('2020-09-08T12:00:12+00:00')) -> 12`
