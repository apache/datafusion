# Write Options

DataFusion supports customizing how data is written out to disk as a result of a `COPY` or `INSERT INTO` query. There are a few special options, file format (e.g. CSV or parquet) specific options, and parquet column specific options. Options can also in some cases be specified in multiple ways with a set order of precedence.

## Specifying Options and Order of Precedence

Write related options can be specified in the following ways:

- Session level config defaults
- `CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE` options
- `COPY` option tuples

For a list of supported session level config defaults see [Configuration Settings](../configs). These defaults apply to all write operations but have the lowest level of precedence.

If inserting to an external table, table specific write options can be specified when the table is created using the `OPTIONS` clause:

```sql
CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE
my_table(a bigint, b bigint)
STORED AS csv
COMPRESSION TYPE gzip
WITH HEADER ROW
DELIMITER ';'
LOCATION '/test/location/my_csv_table/'
OPTIONS(
NULL_VALUE 'NAN'
);
```

When running `INSERT INTO my_table ...`, the options from the `CREATE TABLE` will be respected (gzip compression, special delimiter, and header row included). There will be a single output file if the output path doesn't have folder format, i.e. ending with a `\`. Note that compression, header, and delimiter settings can also be specified within the `OPTIONS` tuple list. Dedicated syntax within the SQL statement always takes precedence over arbitrary option tuples, so if both are specified the `OPTIONS` setting will be ignored. NULL_VALUE is a CSV format specific option that determines how null values should be encoded within the CSV file.

Finally, options can be passed when running a `COPY` command.

```sql
COPY source_table
TO 'test/table_with_options'
(format parquet,
compression snappy,
'compression::col1' 'zstd(5)',
partition_by 'column3, column4'
)
```

In this example, we write the entirety of `source_table` out to a folder of parquet files. One parquet file will be written in parallel to the folder for each partition in the query. The next option `compression` set to `snappy` indicates that unless otherwise specified all columns should use the snappy compression codec. The option `compression::col1` sets an override, so that the column `col1` in the parquet file will use `ZSTD` compression codec with compression level `5`. In general, parquet options which support column specific settings can be specified with the syntax `OPTION::COLUMN.NESTED.PATH`.

## Available Options

### COPY Specific Options

The following special options are specific to the `COPY` command.

| Option       | Description                                                                                                                                                                         | Default Value |
| ------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------- |
| FORMAT       | Specifies the file format COPY query will write out. If there're more than one output file or the format cannot be inferred from the file extension, then FORMAT must be specified. | N/A           |
| PARTITION_BY | Specifies the columns that the output files should be partitioned by into separate hive-style directories. Value should be a comma separated string literal, e.g. 'col1,col2'       | N/A           |

### JSON Format Specific Options

The following options are available when writing JSON files. Note: If any unsupported option is specified, an error will be raised and the query will fail.

| Option      | Description                                                                                                                        | Default Value |
