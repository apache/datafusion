# Window Functions

A _window function_ performs a calculation across a set of table rows that are somehow related to the current row.

Note: this documentation is in the process of being migrated to be [automatically created from the codebase].
Please see the [Window Functions (new)](window_functions_new.md) page for
the rest of the documentation.

Window functions are comparable to the type of calculation that can be done with an aggregate function. However, window functions do not cause rows to become grouped into a single output row like non-window aggregate calls would. Instead, the rows retain their separate identities. Behind the scenes, the window function is able to access more than just the current row of the query result

Here is an example that shows how to compare each employee's salary with the average salary in his or her department:

```sql
SELECT depname, empno, salary, avg(salary) OVER (PARTITION BY depname) FROM empsalary;

+-----------+-------+--------+-------------------+
| depname   | empno | salary | avg               |
+-----------+-------+--------+-------------------+
| personnel | 2     | 3900   | 3700.0            |
| personnel | 5     | 3500   | 3700.0            |
| develop   | 8     | 6000   | 5020.0            |
| develop   | 10    | 5200   | 5020.0            |
| develop   | 11    | 5200   | 5020.0            |
| develop   | 9     | 4500   | 5020.0            |
| develop   | 7     | 4200   | 5020.0            |
| sales     | 1     | 5000   | 4866.666666666667 |
| sales     | 4     | 4800   | 4866.666666666667 |
| sales     | 3     | 4800   | 4866.666666666667 |
+-----------+-------+--------+-------------------+
```

A window function call always contains an OVER clause directly following the window function's name and argument(s). This is what syntactically distinguishes it from a normal function or non-window aggregate. The OVER clause determines exactly how the rows of the query are split up for processing by the window function. The PARTITION BY clause within OVER divides the rows into groups, or partitions, that share the same values of the PARTITION BY expression(s). For each row, the window function is computed across the rows that fall into the same partition as the current row. The previous example showed how to count the average of a column per partition.

You can also control the order in which rows are processed by window functions using ORDER BY within OVER. (The window ORDER BY does not even have to match the order in which the rows are output.) Here is an example:

```sql
SELECT depname, empno, salary,
       rank() OVER (PARTITION BY depname ORDER BY salary DESC)
FROM empsalary;

+-----------+-------+--------+--------+
| depname   | empno | salary | rank   |
+-----------+-------+--------+--------+
| personnel | 2     | 3900   | 1      |
| develop   | 8     | 6000   | 1      |
| develop   | 10    | 5200   | 2      |
| develop   | 11    | 5200   | 2      |
| develop   | 9     | 4500   | 4      |
| develop   | 7     | 4200   | 5      |
| sales     | 1     | 5000   | 1      |
| sales     | 4     | 4800   | 2      |
| personnel | 5     | 3500   | 2      |
| sales     | 3     | 4800   | 2      |
+-----------+-------+--------+--------+
```

There is another important concept associated with window functions: for each row, there is a set of rows within its partition called its window frame. Some window functions act only on the rows of the window frame, rather than of the whole partition. Here is an example of using window frames in queries:

```sql
SELECT depname, empno, salary,
    avg(salary) OVER(ORDER BY salary ASC ROWS BETWEEN 1 PRECEDING AND 1 FOLLOWING) AS avg,
    min(salary) OVER(ORDER BY empno ASC ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW) AS cum_min
FROM empsalary
ORDER BY empno ASC;

+-----------+-------+--------+--------------------+---------+
| depname   | empno | salary | avg                | cum_min |
+-----------+-------+--------+--------------------+---------+
| sales     | 1     | 5000   | 5000.0             | 5000    |
| personnel | 2     | 3900   | 3866.6666666666665 | 3900    |
| sales     | 3     | 4800   | 4700.0             | 3900    |
| sales     | 4     | 4800   | 4866.666666666667  | 3900    |
| personnel | 5     | 3500   | 3700.0             | 3500    |
| develop   | 7     | 4200   | 4200.0             | 3500    |
| develop   | 8     | 6000   | 5600.0             | 3500    |
| develop   | 9     | 4500   | 4500.0             | 3500    |
| develop   | 10    | 5200   | 5133.333333333333  | 3500    |
| develop   | 11    | 5200   | 5466.666666666667  | 3500    |
+-----------+-------+--------+--------------------+---------+
```

When a query involves multiple window functions, it is possible to write out each one with a separate OVER clause, but this is duplicative and error-prone if the same windowing behavior is wanted for several functions. Instead, each windowing behavior can be named in a WINDOW clause and then referenced in OVER. For example:

```sql
SELECT sum(salary) OVER w, avg(salary) OVER w
FROM empsalary
WINDOW w AS (PARTITION BY depname ORDER BY salary DESC);
```

## Syntax

The syntax for the OVER-clause is

```
function([expr])
  OVER(
    [PARTITION BY expr[, …]]
    [ORDER BY expr [ ASC | DESC ][, …]]
    [ frame_clause ]
    )
```

where **frame_clause** is one of:

```
  { RANGE | ROWS | GROUPS } frame_start
  { RANGE | ROWS | GROUPS } BETWEEN frame_start AND frame_end
```

and **frame_start** and **frame_end** can be one of

```sql
UNBOUNDED PRECEDING
offset PRECEDING
CURRENT ROW
offset FOLLOWING
UNBOUNDED FOLLOWING
```

where **offset** is an non-negative integer.

RANGE and GROUPS modes require an ORDER BY clause (with RANGE the ORDER BY must specify exactly one column).

## Aggregate functions

All [aggregate functions](aggregate_functions.md) can be used as window functions.

## Analytical functions

- [first_value](#first_value)
- [last_value](#last_value)
- [nth_value](#nth_value)

### `first_value`

Returns value evaluated at the row that is the first row of the window frame.

```sql
first_value(expression)
```

#### Arguments

- **expression**: Expression to operate on

### `last_value`

Returns value evaluated at the row that is the last row of the window frame.

```sql
last_value(expression)
```

#### Arguments

- **expression**: Expression to operate on

### `nth_value`

Returns value evaluated at the row that is the nth row of the window frame (counting from 1); null if no such row.

```sql
nth_value(expression, n)
```

#### Arguments

- **expression**: The name the column of which nth value to retrieve
- **n**: Integer. Specifies the _n_ in nth
