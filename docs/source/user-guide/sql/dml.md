# DML

DML stands for "Data Manipulation Language" and relates to inserting
and modifying data in tables.

## COPY

Copies the contents of a table or query to file(s). Supported file
formats are `parquet`, `csv`, `json`, and `arrow`.

<pre>
COPY { <i><b>table_name</i></b> | <i><b>query</i></b> } 
TO '<i><b>file_name</i></b>'
[ STORED AS <i><b>format</i></b> ]
[ PARTITIONED BY <i><b>column_name</i></b> [, ...] ]
[ OPTIONS( <i><b>option</i></b> [, ... ] ) ]
</pre>

`STORED AS` specifies the file format the `COPY` command will write. If this
clause is not specified, it will be inferred from the file extension if possible.

`PARTITIONED BY` specifies the columns to use for partitioning the output files into
separate hive-style directories.

The output format is determined by the first match of the following rules:

1. Value of `STORED AS`
2. Value of the `OPTION (FORMAT ..)`
3. Filename extension (e.g. `foo.parquet` implies `PARQUET` format)

For a detailed list of valid OPTIONS, see [Write Options](write_options).

### Examples

Copy the contents of `source_table` to `file_name.json` in JSON format:

```sql
> COPY source_table TO 'file_name.json';
+-------+
| count |
+-------+
| 2     |
+-------+
```

Copy the contents of `source_table` to one or more Parquet formatted
files in the `dir_name` directory:

```sql
> COPY source_table TO 'dir_name' STORED AS PARQUET;
+-------+
| count |
+-------+
| 2     |
+-------+
```

Copy the contents of `source_table` to multiple directories
of hive-style partitioned parquet files:

```sql
> COPY source_table TO 'dir_name' STORED AS parquet, PARTITIONED BY (column1, column2);
+-------+
| count |
+-------+
| 2     |
+-------+
```

If the the data contains values of `x` and `y` in column1 and only `a` in
column2, output files will appear in the following directory structure:

```
dir_name/
  column1=x/
    column2=a/
      <file>.parquet
      <file>.parquet
      ...
  column1=y/
    column2=a/
      <file>.parquet
      <file>.parquet
      ...
```

Run the query `SELECT * from source ORDER BY time` and write the
results (maintaining the order) to a parquet file named
`output.parquet` with a maximum parquet row group size of 10MB:

```sql
> COPY (SELECT * from source ORDER BY time) TO 'output.parquet' OPTIONS (MAX_ROW_GROUP_SIZE 10000000);
+-------+
| count |
+-------+
| 2     |
+-------+
```

## INSERT

### Examples

Insert values into a table.

<pre>
INSERT INTO <i><b>table_name</i></b> { VALUES ( <i><b>expression</i></b> [, ...] ) [, ...] | <i><b>query</i></b> }
</pre>

```sql
> INSERT INTO target_table VALUES (1, 'Foo'), (2, 'Bar');
+-------+
| count |
+-------+
| 2     |
+-------+
```
