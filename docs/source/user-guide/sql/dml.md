# DML

DML stands for "Data Manipulation Language" and relates to inserting
and modifying data in tables.

## COPY

Copies the contents of a table or query to file(s). Supported file
formats are `parquet`, `csv`, and `json` and can be inferred based on
filename if writing to a single file.

<pre>
COPY { <i><b>table_name</i></b> | <i><b>query</i></b> } TO '<i><b>file_name</i></b>' [ ( <i><b>option</i></b> [, ... ] ) ]
</pre>

For a detailed list of valid OPTIONS, see [Write Options](write_options).

Copy the contents of `source_table` to `file_name.json` in JSON format:

```sql
> COPY source_table TO 'file_name.json';
+-------+
| count |
+-------+
| 2     |
+-------+
```

Copy the contents of `source_table` to one or more Parquet formatted
files in the `dir_name` directory:

```sql
> COPY source_table TO 'dir_name' (FORMAT parquet, SINGLE_FILE_OUTPUT false);
+-------+
| count |
+-------+
| 2     |
+-------+
```

Run the query `SELECT * from source ORDER BY time` and write the
results (maintaining the order) to a parquet file named
`output.parquet` with a maximum parquet row group size of 10MB:

```sql
> COPY (SELECT * from source ORDER BY time) TO 'output.parquet' (ROW_GROUP_LIMIT_BYTES 10000000);
+-------+
| count |
+-------+
| 2     |
+-------+
```

## INSERT

Insert values into a table.

<pre>
INSERT INTO <i><b>table_name</i></b> { VALUES ( <i><b>expression</i></b> [, ...] ) [, ...] | <i><b>query</i></b> }
</pre>

```sql
> INSERT INTO target_table VALUES (1, 'Foo'), (2, 'Bar');
+-------+
| count |
+-------+
| 2     |
+-------+
```
