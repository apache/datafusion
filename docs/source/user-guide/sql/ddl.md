# DDL

DataFusion is a _query_ engine and supports DDL only for modifying the catalog and registering external tables,
creating tables in memory, or creating views. In the DataFusion CLI, these changes are not persisted in any way, taking 
place only in memory. The library is the same -- the catalog of tables is not persisted, unless the persistence is built
into the application using the library. You can not insert, update, or delete data using DataFusion SQL.


### CREATE DATABASE

<pre>
CREATE DATABASE [ IF NOT EXISTS ] <b><i>database_name</i></b>;
</pre>

#### Description
Creates a database in the catalog.

#### Example
```sql
CREATE DATABASE test;
```

### CREATE SCHEMA

<pre>
CREATE SCHEMA [ IF NOT EXISTS ] <b><i>schema_name</i></b>;
</pre>

#### Description
Creates a schema in a database

#### Example

Create schema in the `test` database.
```sql
CREATE SCHEMA test.schema_1;
```

### CREATE TABLE
```sql
CREATE TABLE test.schema.t1 AS VALUES (1,2,3);
CREATE TABLE t1 AS SELECT * FROM (VALUES (1,2)) as t(a,b);
```

### DROP TABLE

<pre>
DROP TABLE [ IF EXISTS ] <b><i>table_name</i></b>;
</pre>

#### Description
Drops the table from DataFusion's catalog.

#### Example
```sql
DROP TABLE test.schema.t1;
```

## CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE

Parquet data sources can be registered by executing a `CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE` SQL statement. It is not necessary
to provide schema information for Parquet files.

```sql
CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE taxi
STORED AS PARQUET
LOCATION '/mnt/nyctaxi/tripdata.parquet';
```

```sql
CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE test 
    STORED AS CSV 
    WITH HEADER ROW 
    LOCATION 'c:/tmp/test.csv';
```

Create an external table with partitioned CSV files
```sql
CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE p_test 
    STORED AS CSV 
    WITH HEADER ROW
    PARTITIONED BY (year) 
    LOCATION 'c:/tmp/data';
```

The above statement looks for CSV files in the `c:/tmp/data` directory and creates a table with 
the columns and data types inferred, as well as adding a column for the partition:

TODO: describe rules for inference. which files does it look at, how many rows? is it configurable?

```
❯ \d p_test
+---------------+--------------+------------+-------------+--------------------------+-------------+
| table_catalog | table_schema | table_name | column_name | data_type                | is_nullable |
+---------------+--------------+------------+-------------+--------------------------+-------------+
| datafusion    | public       | p_test     | Region      | Utf8                     | NO          |
| datafusion    | public       | p_test     | Country     | Utf8                     | NO          |
| datafusion    | public       | p_test     | Units       | Int64                    | NO          |
| datafusion    | public       | p_test     | year        | Dictionary(UInt16, Utf8) | NO          |
+---------------+--------------+------------+-------------+--------------------------+-------------+
4 rows in set. Query took 0.003 seconds.
```

CSV data sources can also be registered by executing a `CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE` SQL statement. The schema 
optionally may be specified which prevents DataFusion from attempting to infer the schema, a costly and potentially incorrect operation.

```sql
CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE test (
    c1  VARCHAR NOT NULL,
    c2  INT NOT NULL,
    c3  SMALLINT NOT NULL,
    c4  SMALLINT NOT NULL,
    c5  INT NOT NULL,
    c6  BIGINT NOT NULL,
    c7  SMALLINT NOT NULL,
    c8  INT NOT NULL,
    c9  BIGINT NOT NULL,
    c10 VARCHAR NOT NULL,
    c11 FLOAT NOT NULL,
    c12 DOUBLE NOT NULL,
    c13 VARCHAR NOT NULL
)
STORED AS CSV
WITH HEADER ROW
LOCATION '/path/to/aggregate_test_100.csv';
```

If data sources are already partitioned in Hive style, `PARTITIONED BY` can be used for partition pruning.

```
/mnt/nyctaxi/year=2022/month=01/tripdata.parquet
/mnt/nyctaxi/year=2021/month=12/tripdata.parquet
/mnt/nyctaxi/year=2021/month=11/tripdata.parquet
```

```sql
CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE taxi
STORED AS PARQUET
PARTITIONED BY (year, month)
LOCATION '/mnt/nyctaxi';
```
