# Configuration Settings

The following configuration options can be passed to `SessionConfig` to control various aspects of query execution.

For applications which do not expose `SessionConfig`, like `datafusion-cli`, these options may also be set via environment variables.
To construct a session with options from the environment, use `SessionConfig::from_env`.
The name of the environment variable is the option's key, transformed to uppercase and with periods replaced with underscores.
For example, to configure `datafusion.execution.batch_size` you would set the `DATAFUSION_EXECUTION_BATCH_SIZE` environment variable.
Values are parsed according to the [same rules used in casts from Utf8](https://docs.rs/arrow/latest/arrow/compute/kernels/cast/fn.cast.html).
If the value in the environment variable cannot be cast to the type of the configuration option, the default value will be used instead and a warning emitted.
Environment variables are read during `SessionConfig` initialisation so they must be set beforehand and will not affect running sessions.

The aggregation is considered high-cardinality if the number of affected groups is greater than or equal to `batch_size / scalar_update_factor`. In such cases, `ScalarValue`s are utilized for updating accumulators, rather than the default batch-slice approach. This can lead to performance improvements. By adjusting the `scalar_update_factor`, you can balance the trade-off between more efficient accumulator updates and the number of groups affected. |

Currently Parquet and CSV formats are supported. If set to `true`, all files will be repartitioned evenly (i.e., a single large file might be partitioned into smaller chunks) for parallel scanning. If set to `false`, different files will be read in parallel, but repartitioning won't happen within a single file.                                                                                                                                                                                          |
