# Configuration Settings

The following configuration options can be passed to `SessionConfig` to control various aspects of query execution.

For applications which do not expose `SessionConfig`, like `datafusion-cli`, these options may also be set via environment variables.
To construct a session with options from the environment, use `SessionConfig::from_env`.
The name of the environment variable is the option's key, transformed to uppercase and with periods replaced with underscores.
For example, to configure `datafusion.execution.batch_size` you would set the `DATAFUSION_EXECUTION_BATCH_SIZE` environment variable.
Values are parsed according to the [same rules used in casts from Utf8](https://docs.rs/arrow/latest/arrow/compute/kernels/cast/fn.cast.html).
If the value in the environment variable cannot be cast to the type of the configuration option, the default value will be used instead and a warning emitted.
Environment variables are read during `SessionConfig` initialisation so they must be set beforehand and will not affect running sessions.

| datafusion.execution.coalesce_batches                     | Boolean | true    | When set to true, record batches will be examined between each operator and small batches will be coalesced into larger batches. This is helpful when there are highly selective filters or joins that could produce tiny output batches. The target batch size is determined by the configuration setting 'datafusion.execution.coalesce_target_batch_size'. |
| datafusion.execution.coalesce_target_batch_size           | UInt64  | 4096    | Target batch size when coalescing batches. Uses in conjunction with the configuration setting 'datafusion.execution.coalesce_batches'.                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| datafusion.execution.parquet.enable_page_index            | Boolean | false   | If true, uses parquet data page level metadata (Page Index) statistics to reduce the number of rows decoded.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| datafusion.execution.parquet.metadata_size_hint           | UInt64  | NULL    | If specified, the parquet reader will try and fetch the last `size_hint` bytes of the parquet file optimistically. If not specified, two read are required: One read to fetch the 8-byte parquet footer and another to fetch the metadata length encoded in the footer.                                                                                       |
| datafusion.execution.parquet.pruning                      | Boolean | true    | If true, the parquet reader attempts to skip entire row groups based on the predicate in the query and the metadata (min/max values) stored in the parquet file.                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| datafusion.execution.parquet.pushdown_filters             | Boolean | false   | If true, filter expressions are be applied during the parquet decoding operation to reduce the number of rows decoded.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| datafusion.execution.parquet.reorder_filters              | Boolean | false   | If true, filter expressions evaluated during the parquet decoding opearation will be reordered heuristically to minimize the cost of evaluation. If false, the filters are applied in the same order as written in the query.                                                                                                                                 |
| datafusion.execution.parquet.skip_metadata                | Boolean | true    | If true, the parquet reader skip the optional embedded metadata that may be in the file Schema. This setting can help avoid schema conflicts when querying multiple parquet files with schemas containing compatible types but different metadata.                                                                                                            |

| datafusion.execution.time_zone                            | Utf8    | +00:00  | The session time zone which some function require e.g. EXTRACT(HOUR from SOME_TIME) shift the underline datetime according to the time zone,                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

| datafusion.optimizer.filter_null_join_keys                | Boolean | false   | When set to true, the optimizer will insert filters before a join between a nullable and non-nullable column to filter out nulls on the nullable side. This filter can add additional overhead when the file format does not fully support predicate push down.                                                                                               |
