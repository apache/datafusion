# Configuration Settings

The following configuration options can be passed to `SessionConfig` to control various aspects of query execution.

For applications which do not expose `SessionConfig`, like `datafusion-cli`, these options may also be set via environment variables.
To construct a session with options from the environment, use `SessionConfig::from_env`.
The name of the environment variable is the option's key, transformed to uppercase and with periods replaced with underscores.
For example, to configure `datafusion.execution.batch_size` you would set the `DATAFUSION_EXECUTION_BATCH_SIZE` environment variable.
Values are parsed according to the [same rules used in casts from Utf8](https://docs.rs/arrow/latest/arrow/compute/kernels/cast/fn.cast.html).
If the value in the environment variable cannot be cast to the type of the configuration option, the default value will be used instead and a warning emitted.
Environment variables are read during `SessionConfig` initialisation so they must be set beforehand and will not affect running sessions.

This setting can help avoid schema conflicts when querying multiple parquet files with schemas containing compatible types but different metadata                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

If not specified, two reads are required: One read to fetch the 8-byte parquet footer and another to fetch the metadata length encoded in the footer                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

This optimization is sometimes called "late materialization".                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

If false, the filters are applied in the same order as written in the query                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

Parquet files generated by some legacy writers do not correctly set the UTF8 flag for strings, causing string columns to be loaded as BLOB instead.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

| datafusion.execution.parquet.maximum_buffered_record_batches_per_stream | 2                         | (writing) By default parallel parquet writer is tuned for minimum memory usage in a streaming execution plan. You may see a performance benefit when writing large parquet files by increasing maximum_parallel_row_group_writers and maximum_buffered_record_batches_per_stream if your system has idle cores and can tolerate additional memory usage. Boosting these values is likely worthwhile when writing out already in-memory data, such as from a cached data frame.                                                                                           |
