# DataFrame API

A DataFrame represents a logical set of rows with the same named columns, similar to a [Pandas DataFrame](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.html) or
[Spark DataFrame](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/sql-programming-guide.html).

DataFrames are typically created by calling a method on
`SessionContext`, such as `read_csv`, and can then be modified
by calling the transformation methods, such as `filter`, `select`, `aggregate`, and `limit`
to build up a query definition.

The query can be executed by calling the `collect` method.

The DataFrame struct is part of DataFusion's prelude and can be imported with the following statement.

```rust
use datafusion::prelude::*;
```

Here is a minimal example showing the execution of a query using the DataFrame API.

```rust
let ctx = SessionContext::new();
let df = ctx.read_csv("tests/example.csv", CsvReadOptions::new()).await?;
let df = df.filter(col("a").lt_eq(col("b")))?
           .aggregate(vec![col("a")], vec![min(col("b"))])?
           .limit(0, Some(100))?;
// Print results
df.show();
```

The DataFrame API is well documented in the [API reference on docs.rs](https://docs.rs/datafusion/latest/datafusion/dataframe/struct.DataFrame.html).

Refer to the [Expressions Reference](expressions) for available functions for building logical expressions for use with the
DataFrame API.

## DataFrame Transformations

These methods create a new DataFrame after applying a transformation to the logical plan that the DataFrame represents.

DataFusion DataFrames use lazy evaluation, meaning that each transformation is just creating a new query plan and
not actually performing any transformations. This approach allows for the overall plan to be optimized before
execution. The plan is evaluated (executed) when an action method is invoked, such as `collect`.
