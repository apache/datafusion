# DataFusion Command-line Interface

The DataFusion CLI allows SQL queries to be executed by an in-process DataFusion context, or by a distributed
Ballista context.

```

FLAGS:
    -h, --help       Prints help information
    -q, --quiet      Reduce printing other than the results and work quietly
    -V, --version    Prints version information

OPTIONS:
    -c, --batch-size <batch-size>    The batch size of each query, or use DataFusion default
    -p, --data-path <data-path>      Path to your data, default to current directory
    -f, --file <file>...             Execute commands from file(s), then exit
        --format <format>            Output format [default: table]  [possible values: csv, tsv, table, json, ndjson]
        --host <host>                Ballista scheduler host
        --port <port>                Ballista scheduler port
```

## Example

Create a CSV file to query.

```bash
$ echo "1,2" > data.csv
```

```bash
$ datafusion-cli

DataFusion CLI v5.1.0-SNAPSHOT

> CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE foo (a INT, b INT) STORED AS CSV LOCATION 'data.csv';
