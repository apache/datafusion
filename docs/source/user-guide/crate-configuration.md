# Crate Configuration

This section contains information on how to configure builds of DataFusion in
your Rust project. The [Configuration Settings] section lists options that
control additional aspects DataFusion's runtime behavior.

[configuration settings]: configs.md

## Using the nightly DataFusion builds

DataFusion changes are published to `crates.io` according to the [release schedule](https://github.com/apache/datafusion/blob/main/dev/release/README.md#release-process)

If you would like to use or test versions of the DataFusion code which are
merged but not yet published, you can use Cargo's [support for adding
dependencies] directly to a GitHub branch:

```toml
datafusion = { git = "https://github.com/apache/datafusion", branch = "main"}
```

Also it works on the package level

```toml
datafusion-common = { git = "https://github.com/apache/datafusion", branch = "main", package = "datafusion-common"}
```

And with features

```toml
datafusion = { git = "https://github.com/apache/datafusion", branch = "main", default-features = false, features = ["unicode_expressions"] }
```

## Optimizing Builds

Here are several suggestions to get the Rust compler to produce faster code when
compiling DataFusion. Note that these changes may increase compile time and
binary size.

### Generate Code with CPU Specific Instructions

By default, the Rust compiler produces code that runs on a wide range of CPUs,
but may not take advantage of all the features of your specific CPU (such as
certain [SIMD instructions]). This is especially true for x86_64 CPUs, where the
default target is `x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu`, which only guarantees support for
the `SSE2` instruction set. DataFusion can benefit from the more advanced
instructions in the `AVX2` and `AVX512` to speed up operations like filtering,
aggregation, and joins. To tell the Rust compiler to use these instructions, set
the `RUSTFLAGS` environment variable to specify a more specific target CPU.

We recommend setting `target-cpu` or at least `avx2`, or preferably at least
`native` (whatever the current CPU is). For example, to build and run DataFusion
with optimizations for your current CPU:

```shell
RUSTFLAGS='-C target-cpu=native' cargo run --release
```

[simd instructions]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SIMD

### Enable Link Time Optimization / Single Codegen Unit

You can potentially improve your performance by compiling DataFusion into a
single codegen unit which gives the Rust compiler more opportunity to optimize
across crate boundaries. To do so, modify your projects' `Cargo.toml` to include
`lto = true` and `codegen-units = 1` as shown below. Beware that using a single
codegen unit _significantly_ increases `--release` build times.

```toml
[profile.release]
lto = true
codegen-units = 1
```

### Alternate Allocator: `snmalloc`

You can also use [snmalloc-rs](https://crates.io/crates/snmalloc-rs) crate as
the memory allocator for DataFusion to improve performance. To do so, add the
dependency to your `Cargo.toml` as shown below.

```toml
[dependencies]
snmalloc-rs = "0.3"
```

Then, in `main.rs.` update the memory allocator with the below after your imports:

<!-- Note can't include snmalloc-rs in a runnable example, because it takes over the global allocator -->

```no-run
use datafusion::prelude::*;

#[global_allocator]
static ALLOC: snmalloc_rs::SnMalloc = snmalloc_rs::SnMalloc;

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() -> datafusion::error::Result<()> {
  Ok(())
}
```

## Enable Backtraces

By default, Datafusion returns errors as a plain text message. You can enable more verbose details about the error,
such as backtraces by enabling the `backtrace` feature to your `Cargo.toml` file like this:

```toml
datafusion = { version = "31.0.0", features = ["backtrace"]}
```

Set environment [variables](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/backtrace/index.html#environment-variables)

```bash
RUST_BACKTRACE=1 ./target/debug/datafusion-cli
DataFusion CLI v31.0.0
> select row_numer() over (partition by a order by a) from (select 1 a);
Error during planning: Invalid function 'row_numer'.
Did you mean 'ROW_NUMBER'?

backtrace:    0: std::backtrace_rs::backtrace::libunwind::trace
             at /rustc/5680fa18feaa87f3ff04063800aec256c3d4b4be/library/std/src/../../backtrace/src/backtrace/libunwind.rs:93:5
   1: std::backtrace_rs::backtrace::trace_unsynchronized
             at /rustc/5680fa18feaa87f3ff04063800aec256c3d4b4be/library/std/src/../../backtrace/src/backtrace/mod.rs:66:5
   2: std::backtrace::Backtrace::create
             at /rustc/5680fa18feaa87f3ff04063800aec256c3d4b4be/library/std/src/backtrace.rs:332:13
   3: std::backtrace::Backtrace::capture
             at /rustc/5680fa18feaa87f3ff04063800aec256c3d4b4be/library/std/src/backtrace.rs:298:9
   4: datafusion_common::error::DataFusionError::get_back_trace
             at /datafusion/datafusion/common/src/error.rs:436:30
   5: datafusion_sql::expr::function::<impl datafusion_sql::planner::SqlToRel<S>>::sql_function_to_expr
   ............
```

The backtraces are useful when debugging code. If there is a test in `datafusion/core/src/physical_planner.rs`

```rust
#[tokio::test]
async fn test_get_backtrace_for_failed_code() -> Result<()> {
    let ctx = SessionContext::new();

    let sql = "
    select row_numer() over (partition by a order by a) from (select 1 a);
    ";

    let _ = ctx.sql(sql).await?.collect().await?;

    Ok(())
}
```

To obtain a backtrace:

```bash
cargo build --features=backtrace
RUST_BACKTRACE=1 cargo test --features=backtrace --package datafusion --lib -- physical_planner::tests::test_get_backtrace_for_failed_code --exact --nocapture

running 1 test
Error: Plan("Invalid function 'row_numer'.\nDid you mean 'ROW_NUMBER'?\n\nbacktrace:    0: std::backtrace_rs::backtrace::libunwind::trace\n             at /rustc/129f3b9964af4d4a709d1383930ade12dfe7c081/library/std/src/../../backtrace/src/backtrace/libunwind.rs:105:5\n   1: std::backtrace_rs::backtrace::trace_unsynchronized\n...
```

Note: The backtrace wrapped into systems calls, so some steps on top of the backtrace can be ignored

To show the backtrace in a pretty-printed format use `eprintln!("{e}");`.

```rust
#[tokio::test]
async fn test_get_backtrace_for_failed_code() -> Result<()> {
    let ctx = SessionContext::new();

    let sql = "select row_numer() over (partition by a order by a) from (select 1 a);";

    let _ = match ctx.sql(sql).await {
        Ok(result) => result.show().await?,
        Err(e) => {
            eprintln!("{e}");
        }
    };

    Ok(())
}
```

Then run the test:

```bash
$ RUST_BACKTRACE=1 cargo test --features=backtrace --package datafusion --lib -- physical_planner::tests::test_get_backtrace_for_failed_code --exact --nocapture

running 1 test
Error during planning: Invalid function 'row_numer'.
Did you mean 'ROW_NUMBER'?
