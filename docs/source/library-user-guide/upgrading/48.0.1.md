# Upgrade Guides

## DataFusion 48.0.1

### `datafusion.execution.collect_statistics` now defaults to `true`

The default value of the `datafusion.execution.collect_statistics` configuration
setting is now true. This change impacts users that use that value directly and relied
on its default value being `false`.

This change also restores the default behavior of `ListingTable` to its previous. If you use it directly
you can maintain the current behavior by overriding the default value in your code.

```rust
# /* comment to avoid running
ListingOptions::new(Arc::new(ParquetFormat::default()))
    .with_collect_stat(false)
    // other options
# */
```
