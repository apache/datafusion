# Introduction

The library user guide explains how to use the DataFusion library as a dependency in your Rust project. Please check out the user-guide for more details on how to use DataFusion's SQL and DataFrame APIs, or the contributor guide for details on how to contribute to DataFusion.

If you haven't reviewed the [architecture section in the docs][docs], it's a useful place to get the lay of the land before starting down a specific path.
