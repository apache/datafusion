# DataFusion

<img src="docs/source/_static/images/DataFusion-Logo-Background-White.svg" width="256" alt="logo"/>

DataFusion is an extensible query planning, optimization, and execution framework, written in
Rust, that uses [Apache Arrow](https://arrow.apache.org) as its
in-memory format.

[![Coverage Status](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/arrow-datafusion/rust/branch/master/graph/badge.svg)](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/arrow-datafusion?branch=master)

## Features

- SQL query planner with support for multiple SQL dialects
- DataFrame API
- Parquet, CSV, JSON, and Avro file formats are supported natively. Custom
  file formats can be supported by implementing a `TableProvider` trait.
- Supports popular object stores, including AWS S3, Azure Blob
  Storage, and Google Cloud Storage. There are extension points for implementing
  custom object stores.

## Use Cases

DataFusion is modular in design with many extension points and can be
used without modification as an embedded query engine and can also provide
a foundation for building new systems. Here are some example use cases:

- DataFusion can be used as a SQL query planner and query optimizer, providing
  optimized logical plans that can then be mapped to other execution engines.
- DataFusion is used to create modern, fast and efficient data
  pipelines, ETL processes, and database systems, which need the
  performance of Rust and Apache Arrow and want to provide their users
  the convenience of an SQL interface or a DataFrame API.

## Why DataFusion?

- _High Performance_: Leveraging Rust and Arrow's memory model, DataFusion achieves very high performance
- _Easy to Connect_: Being part of the Apache Arrow ecosystem (Arrow, Parquet and Flight), DataFusion works well with the rest of the big data ecosystem
- _Easy to Embed_: Allowing extension at almost any point in its design, DataFusion can be tailored for your specific use case
- _High Quality_: Extensively tested, both by itself and with the rest of the Arrow ecosystem, DataFusion can be used as the foundation for production systems.

## DataFusion Community Extensions

There are a number of community projects that extend DataFusion or provide integrations with other systems.
