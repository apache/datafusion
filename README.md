# DataFusion

<img src="docs/source/_static/images/DataFusion-Logo-Background-White.svg" width="256"/>

DataFusion is an extensible query execution framework, written in
Rust, that uses [Apache Arrow](https://arrow.apache.org) as its
in-memory format.

DataFusion supports both an SQL and a DataFrame API for building
logical query plans as well as a query optimizer and execution engine
capable of parallel execution against partitioned data sources (CSV
and Parquet) using threads.

DataFusion also supports distributed query execution via the
[Ballista](ballista/README.md) crate.

## Use Cases

DataFusion is used to create modern, fast and efficient data
pipelines, ETL processes, and database systems, which need the
performance of Rust and Apache Arrow and want to provide their users
the convenience of an SQL interface or a DataFrame API.

## Why DataFusion?

- _High Performance_: Leveraging Rust and Arrow's memory model, DataFusion achieves very high performance
- _Easy to Connect_: Being part of the Apache Arrow ecosystem (Arrow, Parquet and Flight), DataFusion works well with the rest of the big data ecosystem
- _Easy to Embed_: Allowing extension at almost any point in its design, DataFusion can be tailored for your specific usecase
- _High Quality_: Extensively tested, both by itself and with the rest of the Arrow ecosystem, DataFusion can be used as the foundation for production systems.

## Example Usage

Run a SQL query against data stored in a CSV:

```rust
use datafusion::prelude::*;
use datafusion::arrow::util::pretty::print_batches;
use datafusion::arrow::record_batch::RecordBatch;

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() -> datafusion::error::Result<()> {
  // register the table
  let mut ctx = ExecutionContext::new();
  ctx.register_csv("example", "tests/example.csv", CsvReadOptions::new()).await?;

  // create a plan to run a SQL query
  let df = ctx.sql("SELECT a, MIN(b) FROM example GROUP BY a LIMIT 100").await?;

  // execute and print results
  df.show().await?;
  Ok(())
}
```

Use the DataFrame API to process data stored in a CSV:

```rust
use datafusion::prelude::*;
use datafusion::arrow::util::pretty::print_batches;
use datafusion::arrow::record_batch::RecordBatch;

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() -> datafusion::error::Result<()> {
  // create the dataframe
  let mut ctx = ExecutionContext::new();
  let df = ctx.read_csv("tests/example.csv", CsvReadOptions::new()).await?;

  let df = df.filter(col("a").lt_eq(col("b")))?
          .aggregate(vec![col("a")], vec![min(col("b"))])?;

  // execute and print results
  df.show_limit(100).await?;
  Ok(())
}
```

Both of these examples will produce

```text
+---+--------+
| a | MIN(b) |
+---+--------+
| 1 | 2      |
+---+--------+
```

## Using DataFusion as a library

DataFusion is [published on crates.io](https://crates.io/crates/datafusion), and is [well documented on docs.rs](https://docs.rs/datafusion/).

To get started, add the following to your `Cargo.toml` file:

```toml
[dependencies]
datafusion = "6.0.0"
```

## Using DataFusion as a binary

DataFusion also includes a simple command-line interactive SQL utility. See the [CLI reference](https://arrow.apache.org/datafusion/cli/index.html) for more information.

## Rust Version Compatbility

This crate is tested with the latest stable version of Rust. We do not currently test against other, older versions of the Rust compiler.

# Supported SQL

This library currently supports many SQL constructs, including

- `CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE X STORED AS PARQUET LOCATION '...';` to register a table's locations
- `SELECT ... FROM ...` together with any expression
- `ALIAS` to name an expression
- `CAST` to change types, including e.g. `Timestamp(Nanosecond, None)`
- Many mathematical unary and binary expressions such as `+`, `/`, `sqrt`, `tan`, `>=`.
- `WHERE` to filter
- `GROUP BY` together with one of the following aggregations: `MIN`, `MAX`, `COUNT`, `SUM`, `AVG`, `CORR`, `VAR`, `COVAR`, `STDDEV` (sample and population)
- `ORDER BY` together with an expression and optional `ASC` or `DESC` and also optional `NULLS FIRST` or `NULLS LAST`

## Supported Functions

DataFusion strives to implement a subset of the [PostgreSQL SQL dialect](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/functions.html) where possible. We explicitly choose a single dialect to maximize interoperability with other tools and allow reuse of the PostgreSQL documents and tutorials as much as possible.

Currently, only a subset of the PostgreSQL dialect is implemented, and we will document any deviations.

## Schema Metadata / Information Schema Support

DataFusion supports the showing metadata about the tables available. This information can be accessed using the views of the ISO SQL `information_schema` schema or the DataFusion specific `SHOW TABLES` and `SHOW COLUMNS` commands.

More information can be found in the [Postgres docs](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/13/infoschema-schema.html)).

To show tables available for use in DataFusion, use the `SHOW TABLES` command or the `information_schema.tables` view:

```sql
> show tables;
+---------------+--------------------+------------+------------+
| table_catalog | table_schema       | table_name | table_type |
+---------------+--------------------+------------+------------+
| datafusion    | public             | t          | BASE TABLE |
| datafusion    | information_schema | tables     | VIEW       |
+---------------+--------------------+------------+------------+

> select * from information_schema.tables;

+---------------+--------------------+------------+--------------+
| table_catalog | table_schema       | table_name | table_type   |
+---------------+--------------------+------------+--------------+
| datafusion    | public             | t          | BASE TABLE   |
| datafusion    | information_schema | TABLES     | SYSTEM TABLE |
+---------------+--------------------+------------+--------------+
```

To show the schema of a table in DataFusion, use the `SHOW COLUMNS` command or the or `information_schema.columns` view:

```sql
> show columns from t;
+---------------+--------------+------------+-------------+-----------+-------------+
| table_catalog | table_schema | table_name | column_name | data_type | is_nullable |
+---------------+--------------+------------+-------------+-----------+-------------+
| datafusion    | public       | t          | a           | Int32     | NO          |
| datafusion    | public       | t          | b           | Utf8      | NO          |
| datafusion    | public       | t          | c           | Float32   | NO          |
+---------------+--------------+------------+-------------+-----------+-------------+

>   select table_name, column_name, ordinal_position, is_nullable, data_type from information_schema.columns;
+------------+-------------+------------------+-------------+-----------+
| table_name | column_name | ordinal_position | is_nullable | data_type |
+------------+-------------+------------------+-------------+-----------+
| t          | a           | 0                | NO          | Int32     |
| t          | b           | 1                | NO          | Utf8      |
| t          | c           | 2                | NO          | Float32   |
+------------+-------------+------------------+-------------+-----------+
```

## Supported Data Types

DataFusion uses Arrow, and thus the Arrow type system, for query
execution. The SQL types from
[sqlparser-rs](https://github.com/ballista-compute/sqlparser-rs/blob/main/src/ast/data_type.rs#L57)
are mapped to Arrow types according to the following table

| SQL Data Type | Arrow DataType                    |
| ------------- | --------------------------------- |
| `CHAR`        | `Utf8`                            |
| `VARCHAR`     | `Utf8`                            |
| `UUID`        | _Not yet supported_               |
| `CLOB`        | _Not yet supported_               |
| `BINARY`      | _Not yet supported_               |
| `VARBINARY`   | _Not yet supported_               |
| `DECIMAL`     | `Float64`                         |

| `SMALLINT`    | `Int16`                           |
| `INT`         | `Int32`                           |
| `BIGINT`      | `Int64`                           |
| `REAL`        | `Float32`                         |
| `DOUBLE`      | `Float64`                         |
| `BOOLEAN`     | `Boolean`                         |
| `DATE`        | `Date32`                          |
| `TIME`        | `Time64(TimeUnit::Millisecond)`   |
| `TIMESTAMP`   | `Timestamp(TimeUnit::Nanosecond)` |
| `INTERVAL`    | _Not yet supported_               |
| `REGCLASS`    | _Not yet supported_               |
| `TEXT`        | _Not yet supported_               |
| `BYTEA`       | _Not yet supported_               |
| `CUSTOM`      | _Not yet supported_               |
| `ARRAY`       | _Not yet supported_               |
