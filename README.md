DataFusion is an extensible query engine written in [Rust] that
uses [Apache Arrow] as its in-memory format. DataFusion's target users are
developers building fast and feature rich database and analytic systems,
customized to particular workloads. See [use cases] for examples.

"Out of the box," DataFusion offers [SQL] and [`Dataframe`] APIs,
excellent [performance], built-in support for CSV, Parquet, JSON, and Avro,
extensive customization, and a great community.
[Python Bindings] are also available.

DataFusion features a full query planner, a columnar, streaming, multi-threaded,
vectorized execution engine, and partitioned data sources. You can
customize DataFusion at almost all points including additional data sources,
query languages, functions, custom operators and more.
See the [Architecture] section for more details.

## Rust Version Compatibility Policy

DataFusion's Minimum Required Stable Rust Version (MSRV) policy is to support stable [4 latest
Rust versions](https://releases.rs) OR the stable minor Rust version as of 4 months, whichever is lower.

For example, given the releases `1.78.0`, `1.79.0`, `1.80.0`, `1.80.1` and `1.81.0` DataFusion will support 1.78.0, which is 3 minor versions prior to the most minor recent `1.81`.

If a hotfix is released for the minimum supported Rust version (MSRV), the MSRV will be the minor version with all hotfixes, even if it surpasses the four-month window.

We enforce this policy using a [MSRV CI Check](https://github.com/search?q=repo%3Aapache%2Fdatafusion+rust-version+language%3ATOML+path%3A%2F%5ECargo.toml%2F&type=code)
