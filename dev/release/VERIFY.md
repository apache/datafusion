# Verifying Arrow releases

## Windows

We've provided a convenience script for verifying the C++ and Python builds on
Windows. Read the comments in `verify-release-candidate.bat` for instructions.

## Linux and macOS

We've provided a convenience script for verifying the C++, Python, C
GLib, Java and JavaScript builds on Linux and macOS. Read the comments in
`verify-release-candidate.sh` for instructions.

### C GLib

You need the followings to verify C GLib build:

- GLib
- GObject Introspection
- Ruby (not EOL-ed version is required)
- gobject-introspection gem
- test-unit gem

You can install them by the followings on Debian GNU/Linux and Ubuntu:

```console
% sudo apt install -y -V libgirepository1.0-dev ruby-dev
% sudo gem install gobject-introspection test-unit
```

You can install them by the followings on CentOS:

```console
% sudo yum install -y gobject-introspection-devel
% git clone https://github.com/sstephenson/rbenv.git ~/.rbenv
% git clone https://github.com/sstephenson/ruby-build.git ~/.rbenv/plugins/ruby-build
% echo 'export PATH="$HOME/.rbenv/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bash_profile
% echo 'eval "$(rbenv init -)"' >> ~/.bash_profile
% exec ${SHELL} --login
% sudo yum install -y gcc make patch openssl-devel readline-devel zlib-devel
% rbenv install 2.4.2
% rbenv global 2.4.2
% gem install gobject-introspection test-unit
```

You can install them by the followings on macOS:

```console
% brew install -y gobject-introspection
% gem install gobject-introspection test-unit
```

You need to set `PKG_CONFIG_PATH` to find libffi on macOS:

```console
% export PKG_CONFIG_PATH=$(brew --prefix libffi)/lib/pkgconfig:$PKG_CONFIG_PATH
```
