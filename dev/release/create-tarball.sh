# This script creates a signed tarball in
# dev/dist/apache-arrow-datafusion-<version>-<sha>.tar.gz and uploads it to
# the "dev" area of the dist.apache.arrow repository and prepares an
# email for sending to the dev@arrow.apache.org list for a formal
# vote.
#
# See release/README.md for full release instructions
#
# Requirements:
#
# 1. gpg setup for signing and have uploaded your public
# signature to https://pgp.mit.edu/
#
# 2. Logged into the apache svn server with the appropriate
# credentials
#
# 3. Install the requests python package
#
#
# Based in part on 02-source.sh from apache/arrow

Subject: [VOTE][RUST][DataFusion] Release Apache Arrow DataFusion ${version} RC${rc}
Hi,

I would like to propose a release of Apache Arrow DataFusion Implementation,
version ${version}.

This release candidate is based on commit: ${release_hash} [1]
The proposed release tarball and signatures are hosted at [2].
The changelog is located at [3].

Please download, verify checksums and signatures, run the unit tests, and vote
on the release. The vote will be open for at least 72 hours.

Only votes from PMC members are binding, but all members of the community are
encouraged to test the release and vote with "(non-binding)".

The standard verification procedure is documented at https://github.com/apache/arrow-datafusion/blob/master/dev/release/README.md#verifying-release-candidates.

[ ] +1 Release this as Apache Arrow DataFusion ${version}
[ ] +0
[ ] -1 Do not release this as Apache Arrow DataFusion ${version} because...

Here is my vote:

+1

[1]: https://github.com/apache/arrow-datafusion/tree/${release_hash}
[2]: ${url}
