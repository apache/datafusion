# Apache DataFusion 50.0.0 Changelog

This release is under active development.

- **Breaking:** `DynamicFilterPhysicalExpr::update` now requires an extra
  `key_count` argument.
- Enable dynamic filter pushdown for left, right, semi, anti, and mark joins
  [#16445](https://github.com/apache/datafusion/pull/16445) (adriangb). Mark joins
  push filters to the side opposite the preserved input (`dynamic_filter_side`; see
  [tests](https://github.com/apache/datafusion/blob/main/datafusion/physical-plan/src/joins/hash_join.rs#L2033-L2049)). Formats without predicate pushdown (CSV/JSON) will not benefit.
  Full joins and nonâ€‘equi (range or composite) predicates are not yet supported;
  see [#7955](https://github.com/apache/datafusion/issues/7955). Dynamic filters
  add planning overhead for high-cardinality keys; disable via:

  ```bash
  export DATAFUSION_OPTIMIZER_ENABLE_DYNAMIC_FILTER_PUSHDOWN=0
  ```

  or by setting `datafusion.optimizer.enable_dynamic_filter_pushdown=false`
  programmatically.
