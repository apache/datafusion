# Apache DataFusion 50.0.0 Changelog

This release is under active development.

- Enable dynamic filter pushdown for left, right, semi, anti, and mark joins [#16445](https://github.com/apache/datafusion/pull/16445) (adriangb).
  This non-breaking change is enabled by default and supports pruning the probe side of `Inner`, `Left`, `Right`, `LeftSemi`, `LeftAnti`, `RightSemi`, `RightAnti`, `LeftMark`, and `RightMark` hash joins.
  For example, in star-schema workloads joining `dim` tables to a large `fact` table, dynamic filters can drop entire partitions of the `fact` table before they are scanned.
  Full joins and nonâ€‘equi (range or composite) predicates are not yet supported; see [#7955](https://github.com/apache/datafusion/issues/7955).
  Dynamic filters add planning overhead for high-cardinality keys; disable via the environment variable:

  ```bash
  export DATAFUSION_OPTIMIZER_ENABLE_DYNAMIC_FILTER_PUSHDOWN=0
  ```

  or by setting `datafusion.optimizer.enable_dynamic_filter_pushdown=false` programmatically if necessary.
