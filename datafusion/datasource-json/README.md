# Apache DataFusion JSON DataSource

[Apache DataFusion] is an extensible query execution framework, written in Rust, that uses [Apache Arrow] as its in-memory format.

This crate is a submodule of DataFusion that defines a JSON based file source.

Most projects should use the [`datafusion`] crate directly, which re-exports
this module. If you are already using the [`datafusion`] crate, there is no
reason to use this crate directly in your project as well.
