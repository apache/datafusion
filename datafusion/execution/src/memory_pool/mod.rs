/// Tracks and potentially limits memory use across operators during execution.
///
/// # Memory Management Overview
///
/// DataFusion is a streaming query engine, processing most queries without
/// buffering the entire input. Most operators require a fixed amount of memory
/// based on the schema and target batch size. However, certain operations such
/// as sorting and grouping/joining, require buffering intermediate results,
/// which can require memory proportional to the number of input rows.
///
/// Rather than tracking all allocations, DataFusion takes a pragmatic approach:
/// Intermediate memory used as data streams through the system is not accounted
/// (it assumed to be "small") but the large consumers of memory must register
/// and constrain their use. This design trades off the additional code
/// complexity of memory tracking with limiting resource usage.
///
/// When limiting memory with a `MemoryPool` you should typically reserve some
/// overhead (e.g. 10%) for the "small" memory allocations that are not tracked.
///
/// # Memory Management Design
///
/// As explained above, DataFusion's design ONLY limits operators that require
/// "large" amounts of memory (proportional to number of input rows), such as
/// `GroupByHashExec`. It does NOT track and limit memory used internally by
/// other operators such as `ParquetExec` or the `RecordBatch`es that flow
/// between operators.
///
/// In order to avoid allocating memory until the OS or the container system
/// kills the process, DataFusion `ExecutionPlan`s (operators) that consume
/// large amounts of memory must first request their desired allocation from a
/// [`MemoryPool`] before allocating more.  The request is typically managed via
/// a  [`MemoryReservation`] and [`MemoryConsumer`].
///
/// If the allocation is successful, the operator should proceed and allocate
/// the desired memory. If the allocation fails, the operator must either first
/// free memory (e.g. by spilling to local disk) and try again, or error.
///
/// Note that a `MemoryPool` can be shared by concurrently executing plans,
/// which can be used to control memory usage in a multi-tenant system.
///
/// # How MemoryPool works by example
///
/// Scenario 1:
/// For `Filter` operator, `RecordBatch`es will stream through it, so it
/// don't have to keep track of memory usage through [`MemoryPool`].
///
/// Scenario 2:
/// For `CrossJoin` operator, if the input size gets larger, the intermediate
/// state will also grow. So `CrossJoin` operator will use [`MemoryPool`] to
/// limit the memory usage.
/// 2.1 `CrossJoin` operator has read a new batch, asked memory pool for
/// additional memory. Memory pool updates the usage and returns success.
/// 2.2 `CrossJoin` has read another batch, and tries to reserve more memory
/// again, memory pool does not have enough memory. Since `CrossJoin` operator
/// has not implemented spilling, it will stop execution and return an error.
///
/// Scenario 3:
/// For `Aggregate` operator, its intermediate states will also accumulate as
/// the input size gets larger, but with spilling capability. When it tries to
/// reserve more memory from the memory pool, and the memory pool has already
/// reached the memory limit, it will return an error. Then, `Aggregate`
/// operator will spill the intermediate buffers to disk, and release memory
/// from the memory pool, and continue to retry memory reservation.
///
/// # Implementing `MemoryPool`
///
/// You can implement a custom allocation policy by implementing the
/// [`MemoryPool`] trait and configuring a `SessionContext` appropriately.
/// However, DataFusion comes with the following simple memory pool implementations that
/// handle many common cases:
///
/// * [`UnboundedMemoryPool`]: no memory limits (the default)
///
/// * [`GreedyMemoryPool`]: Limits memory usage to a fixed size using a "first
///   come first served" policy
///
/// * [`FairSpillPool`]: Limits memory usage to a fixed size, allocating memory
///   to all spilling operators fairly
