/// DataFusion is a streaming query engine, processing most queries
/// without buffering the entire input. However, certain operations
/// such as sorting and grouping/joining with a large number of
/// distinct groups/keys, can require buffering intermediate results
/// and for large datasets this can require large amounts of memory.
///
/// In order to avoid allocating memory until the OS or the container
/// system kills the process, DataFusion operators only allocate
/// memory they are able to reserve from the configured
/// [`MemoryPool`]. Once the memory tracked by the pool is exhausted,
/// operators must either free memory by spilling to local disk or
/// error.
///
/// A `MemoryPool` can be shared by concurrently executing plans in
/// the same process to control memory usage in a multi-tenant system.
///
/// The following memory pool implementations are available:
///
/// * [`UnboundedMemoryPool`](pool::UnboundedMemoryPool)
/// * [`GreedyMemoryPool`](pool::GreedyMemoryPool)
