/// API for inspecting and rewriting tree data structures.
///
/// The `TreeNode` API is used to express algorithms separately from traversing
/// the structure of `TreeNode`s, avoiding substantial code duplication.
///
/// This trait is implemented for plans ([`ExecutionPlan`], [`LogicalPlan`]) and
/// expression trees ([`PhysicalExpr`], [`Expr`]) as well as Plan+Payload
/// combinations [`PlanContext`] and [`ExprContext`].
///
/// # Overview
/// There are three categories of TreeNode APIs:
///
/// 1. "Inspecting" APIs to traverse a tree of `&TreeNodes`:
///    [`apply`], [`visit`], [`exists`].
///
/// 2. "Transforming" APIs that traverse and consume a tree of `TreeNode`s
///    producing possibly changed `TreeNode`s: [`transform`], [`transform_up`],
///    [`transform_down`], [`transform_down_up`], and [`rewrite`].
///
/// 3. Internal APIs used to implement the `TreeNode` API: [`apply_children`],
///    and [`map_children`].
///
/// | Traversal Order | Inspecting | Transforming |
/// | --- | --- | --- |
/// | top-down | [`apply`], [`exists`] | [`transform_down`]|
/// | bottom-up | | [`transform`] , [`transform_up`]|
/// | combined with separate `f_down` and `f_up` closures | | [`transform_down_up`] |
/// | combined with `f_down()` and `f_up()` in an object | [`visit`]  | [`rewrite`] |
///
/// **Note**:while there is currently no in-place mutation API that uses `&mut
/// TreeNode`, the transforming APIs are efficient and optimized to avoid
/// cloning.
///
/// [`apply`]: Self::apply
/// [`visit`]: Self::visit
/// [`exists`]: Self::exists
/// [`transform`]: Self::transform
/// [`transform_up`]: Self::transform_up
/// [`transform_down`]: Self::transform_down
/// [`transform_down_up`]: Self::transform_down_up
/// [`rewrite`]: Self::rewrite
/// [`apply_children`]: Self::apply_children
/// [`map_children`]: Self::map_children
///
/// # Terminology
/// The following terms are used in this trait
///
/// * `f_down`: Invoked before any children of the current node are visited.
/// * `f_up`: Invoked after all children of the current node are visited.
/// * `f`: closure that is applied to the current node.
/// * `map_*`: applies a transformation to rewrite owned nodes
/// * `apply_*`:  invokes a function on borrowed nodes
/// * `transform_`: applies a transformation to rewrite owned nodes
