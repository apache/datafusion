    /// Therefore, timestamp values with a non-empty timezone correspond to

    ///   corresponds to "January 1st 1970, 00h00" in the UTC timezone, but the
    ///   application may prefer to display it as "January 1st 1970, 01h00" in
    ///   the Europe/Paris timezone (which is the same physical point in time).
    ///
    /// One consequence is that timestamp values with a non-empty timezone
    /// can be compared and ordered directly, since they all share the same
    /// well-known point of reference (the Unix epoch).
    ///
    /// Timestamps with an unset / empty timezone
    /// -----------------------------------------
    ///
    /// If a Timestamp column has no timezone value, its epoch is
    /// 1970-01-01 00:00:00 (January 1st 1970, midnight) in an *unknown* timezone.
    ///
    /// Therefore, timestamp values without a timezone cannot be meaningfully
    /// interpreted as physical points in time, but only as calendar / clock
    /// indications ("wall clock time") in an unspecified timezone.
    ///
    ///   For example, the timestamp value 0 with an empty timezone string
    ///   corresponds to "January 1st 1970, 00h00" in an unknown timezone: there
    ///   is not enough information to interpret it as a well-defined physical
    ///   point in time.
    ///
    /// One consequence is that timestamp values without a timezone cannot
    /// be reliably compared or ordered, since they may have different points of
    /// reference.  In particular, it is *not* possible to interpret an unset
    /// or empty timezone as the same as "UTC".
    ///
    /// Conversion between timezones
    /// ----------------------------
    ///
    /// If a Timestamp column has a non-empty timezone, changing the timezone
    /// to a different non-empty value is a metadata-only operation:
    /// the timestamp values need not change as their point of reference remains
    /// the same (the Unix epoch).
    ///
    /// However, if a Timestamp column has no timezone value, changing it to a
    /// non-empty value requires to think about the desired semantics.
    /// One possibility is to assume that the original timestamp values are
    /// relative to the epoch of the timezone being set; timestamp values should
    /// then adjusted to the Unix epoch (for example, changing the timezone from
    /// empty to "Europe/Paris" would require converting the timestamp values
