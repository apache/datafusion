/// Represents a catalog, comprising a number of named schemas.
///
/// # Catalog Overview
///
/// To plan and execute queries, DataFusion needs a "Catalog" that provides
/// metadata such as which schemas and tables exist, their columns and data
/// types, and how to access the data.
///
/// The Catalog API consists:
/// * [`CatalogProviderList`]: a collection of `CatalogProvider`s
/// * [`CatalogProvider`]: a collection of `SchemaProvider`s (sometimes called a "database" in other systems)
/// * [`SchemaProvider`]:  a collection of `TableProvider`s (often called a "schema" in other systems)
/// * [`TableProvider`]:  individual tables
///
/// # Implementing Catalogs
///
/// To implement a catalog, you implement at least one of the [`CatalogProviderList`],
/// [`CatalogProvider`] and [`SchemaProvider`] traits and register them
/// appropriately in the `SessionContext`.
///
/// DataFusion comes with a simple in-memory catalog implementation,
/// `MemoryCatalogProvider`, that is used by default and has no persistence.
/// DataFusion does not include more complex Catalog implementations because
/// catalog management is a key design choice for most data systems, and thus
/// it is unlikely that any general-purpose catalog implementation will work
/// well across many use cases.
///
/// # Implementing "Remote" catalogs
///
/// Sometimes catalog information is stored remotely and requires a network call
/// to retrieve. For example, the [Delta Lake] table format stores table
/// metadata in files on S3 that must be first downloaded to discover what
/// schemas and tables exist.
///
/// [Delta Lake]: https://delta.io/
///
/// The [`CatalogProvider`] can support this use case, but it takes some care.
/// The planning APIs in DataFusion are not `async` and thus network IO can not
/// be performed "lazily" / "on demand" during query planning. The rationale for
/// this design is that using remote procedure calls for all catalog accesses
/// required for query planning would likely result in multiple network calls
/// per plan, resulting in very poor planning performance.
///
/// To implement [`CatalogProvider`] and [`SchemaProvider`] for remote catalogs,
/// you need to provide an in memory snapshot of the required metadata. Most
/// systems typically either already have this information cached locally or can
/// batch access to the remote catalog to retrieve multiple schemas and tables
/// in a single network call.
///
/// Note that [`SchemaProvider::table`] is an `async` function in order to
/// simplify implementing simple [`SchemaProvider`]s. For many table formats it
/// is easy to list all available tables but there is additional non trivial
/// access required to read table details (e.g. statistics).
///
/// The pattern that DataFusion itself uses to plan SQL queries is to walk over
/// the query to find all table references,
/// performing required remote catalog in parallel, and then plans the query
/// using that snapshot.
///
/// # Example Catalog Implementations
///
/// Here are some examples of how to implement custom catalogs:
///
/// * [`datafusion-cli`]: [`DynamicFileCatalogProvider`] catalog provider
///   that treats files and directories on a filesystem as tables.
///
/// * The [`catalog.rs`]:  a simple directory based catalog.
///
/// * [delta-rs]:  [`UnityCatalogProvider`] implementation that can
///   read from Delta Lake tables
///
