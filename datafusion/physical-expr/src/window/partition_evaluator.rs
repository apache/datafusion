/// Partition evaluator for Window Functions
///
/// # Background
///
/// An implementation of this trait is created and used for each
/// partition defined by an `OVER` clause and is instantiated by
/// [`BuiltInWindowFunctionExpr::create_evaluator`]
///
/// For example, evaluating `window_func(val) OVER (PARTITION BY col)`
/// on the following data:
///
/// ```text
/// col | val
/// --- + ----
///  A  | 10
///  A  | 10
///  C  | 20
///  D  | 30
///  D  | 30
/// ```
///
/// Will instantiate three `PartitionEvaluator`s, one each for the
/// partitions defined by `col=A`, `col=B`, and `col=C`.
///
/// ```text
/// col | val
/// --- + ----
///  A  | 10     <--- partition 1
///  A  | 10
///
/// col | val
/// --- + ----
///  C  | 20     <--- partition 2
///
/// col | val
/// --- + ----
///  D  | 30     <--- partition 3
///  D  | 30
/// ```
///
/// Different methods on this trait will be called depending on the
/// capabilities described by [`BuiltInWindowFunctionExpr`]:
///
/// # Stateless `PartitionEvaluator`
///
/// In this case, [`Self::evaluate`], [`Self::evaluate_with_rank`] or
/// [`Self::evaluate_inside_range`] is called with values for the
/// entire partition.
///
/// # Stateful `PartitionEvaluator`
///
/// In this case, [`Self::evaluate_stateful`] is called to calculate
/// the results of the window function incrementally for each new
/// batch.
///
/// For example, when computing `ROW_NUMBER` incrementally,
/// [`Self::evaluate_stateful`] will be called multiple times with
/// different batches. For all batches after the first, the output
/// `row_number` must start from last `row_number` produced for the
/// previous batch. The previous row number is saved and restored as
/// the state.
