#### Overview

This is the Datafusion implementation of [sqllogictest](https://www.sqlite.org/sqllogictest/doc/trunk/about.wiki). We use [sqllogictest-rs](https://github.com/risinglightdb/sqllogictest-rs) as a parser/runner of `.slt` files in `test_files`.

#### Running tests: Validation Mode

In this model, `sqllogictests` runs the statements and queries in a `.slt` file, comparing the expected output in the file to the output produced by that run.

Run all tests suites in validation mode

```shell
cargo test -p datafusion --test sqllogictests
```

Run tests with debug logging enabled:

```shell
RUST_LOG=debug cargo test -p datafusion --test sqllogictests
```

Run only the tests in `information_schema.slt`:

```shell
# information_schema.slt matches due to substring matching `information`
cargo test -p datafusion --test sqllogictests -- information
```

#### Running tests: Postgres compatibility

Test files that start with prefix `pg_compat_` verify compatibility
with Postgres by running the same script files both with DataFusion and with Posgres

In order to run the sqllogictests running against a previously running Postgres instance, do:

```shell
PG_COMPAT=true PG_URI="postgresql://postgres@127.0.0.1/postgres" cargo test -p datafusion --test sqllogictests
```

The environemnt variables:

1. `PG_COMPAT` instructs sqllogictest to run against Postgres (not DataFusion)
2. `PG_URI` contains a `libpq` style connection string, whose format is described in
   [the docs](https://docs.rs/tokio-postgres/latest/tokio_postgres/config/struct.Config.html#url)

One way to create a suitable a posgres container in docker is to use
the [Official Image](https://hub.docker.com/_/postgres) with a command
such as the following. Note the collation **must** be set to `C` otherwise
`ORDER BY` will not match DataFusion and the tests will diff.

```shell
docker run \
  -p5432:5432 \
  -e POSTGRES_INITDB_ARGS="--encoding=UTF-8 --lc-collate=C --lc-ctype=C" \
  -e POSTGRES_HOST_AUTH_METHOD=trust \
  postgres
```

#### Updating tests: Completion Mode

In test script completion mode, `sqllogictests` reads a prototype script and runs the statements and queries against the database engine. The output is is a full script that is a copy of the prototype script with result inserted.

You can update tests by passing the `--complete` argument.

```shell
# Update ddl.slt with output from running
cargo test -p datafusion --test sqllogictests -- ddl --complete
```

#### sqllogictests

> :warning: **Warning**:Datafusion's sqllogictest implementation and migration is still in progress. Definitions taken from https://www.sqlite.org/sqllogictest/doc/trunk/about.wiki

sqllogictest is a program originally written for SQLite to verify the correctness of SQL queries against the SQLite engine. The program is engine-agnostic and can parse sqllogictest files (`.slt`), runs queries against an SQL engine and compare the output to the expected output.

Tests in the `.slt` file are a sequence of query record generally starting with `CREATE` statements to populate tables and then further queries to test the populated data (arrow-datafusion exception).

Query records follow the format:

```sql
# <test_name>
query <type_string> <sort_mode>
<sql_query>
----
<expected_result>
```

- `test_name`: Uniquely identify the test name (arrow-datafusion only)
- `type_string`: A short string that specifies the number of result columns and the expected datatype of each result column. There is one character in the <type_string> for each result column. The characters codes are:
  - "T" for a text result,
  - "I" for an integer result,
  - "R" for a floating-point result,
  - "?" for any other type.
- `expected_result`: In the results section, some values are converted according to some rules:
  - floating point values are rounded to the scale of "12",
  - NULL values are rendered as `NULL`,
  - empty strings are rendered as `(empty)`,
  - boolean values are rendered as `true`/`false`,
  - this list can be not exhaustive, check the `datafusion/core/tests/sqllogictests/src/engines/conversion.rs` for details.
- `sort_mode`: If included, it must be one of `nosort` (**default**), `rowsort`, or `valuesort`. In `nosort` mode, the results appear in exactly the order in which they were received from the database engine. The `nosort` mode should only be used on queries that have an `ORDER BY` clause or which only have a single row of result, since otherwise the order of results is undefined and might vary from one database engine to another. The `rowsort` mode gathers all output from the database engine then sorts it by rows on the client side. Sort comparisons use [sort_unstable](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/primitive.slice.html#method.sort_unstable) on the rendered text representation of the values. Hence, "9" sorts after "10", not before. The `valuesort` mode works like `rowsort` except that it does not honor row groupings. Each individual result value is sorted on its own.

> :warning: It is encouraged to either apply `order by`, or use `rowsort` for queries without explicit `order by` clauses.

##### Example

```sql
# group_by_distinct
query TTI
SELECT a, b, COUNT(DISTINCT c) FROM my_table GROUP BY a, b ORDER BY a, b
----
foo bar 10
foo baz 5
foo     4
        3
```
