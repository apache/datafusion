//! This module contains the shared state available at different parts
//! of query planning and execution
//!
//! # Runtime Environment
//!
//! [`runtime_env::RuntimeEnv`] can be created from a [`runtime_env::RuntimeConfig`] and
//! stores state to be shared across multiple sessions. In most applications there will
//! be a single [`runtime_env::RuntimeEnv`] for the entire process
//!
//! # Session Context
//!
//! [`context::SessionContext`] can be created from a [`context::SessionConfig`] and
//! an optional [`runtime_env::RuntimeConfig`], and stores the state for a particular
//! query session.
//!
//! In particular [`context::SessionState`] is the information available to query planning
//!
//! # Task Context
//!
//! [`context::TaskContext`] is typically created from a [`context::SessionContext`] or
//! [`context::SessionState`], and represents the state available to query execution.
//!
//! In particular it is the state passed to [`crate::physical_plan::ExecutionPlan::execute`]
//!
