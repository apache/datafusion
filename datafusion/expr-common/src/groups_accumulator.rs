/// # Notes on Implementing `GroupAccumulator`
///
/// All aggregates must first implement the simpler [`Accumulator`] trait, which
/// handles state for a single group. Implementing `GroupsAccumulator` is
/// optional and is harder to implement than `Accumulator`, but can be much
/// faster for queries with many group values.  See the [Aggregating Millions of
/// Groups Fast blog] for more background.
///
/// # Details
/// Each group is assigned a `group_index` by the hash table and each
/// accumulator manages the specific state, one per `group_index`.
///
/// `group_index`es are contiguous (there aren't gaps), and thus it is
/// expected that each `GroupAccumulator` will use something like `Vec<..>`
/// to store the group states.

    /// often does not reduce the cardinality enough to warrant the memory and
