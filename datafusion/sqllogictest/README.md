# DataFusion sqllogictest

[DataFusion][df] is an extensible query execution framework, written in Rust, that uses Apache Arrow as its in-memory format.

This crate is a submodule of DataFusion that contains an implementation of [sqllogictest](https://www.sqlite.org/sqllogictest/doc/trunk/about.wiki).

[df]: https://crates.io/crates/datafusion

## Overview

This crate uses [sqllogictest-rs](https://github.com/risinglightdb/sqllogictest-rs) to parse and run `.slt` files in the
[`test_files`](test_files) directory of this crate.

## Testing setup

1. `rustup update stable` DataFusion uses the latest stable release of rust
2. `git submodule init`
3. `git submodule update`

## Running tests: TLDR Examples

```shell
# Run all tests
cargo test --test sqllogictests
```

```shell
# Run all tests, with debug logging enabled
RUST_LOG=debug cargo test --test sqllogictests
```

```shell
# Run only the tests in `information_schema.slt`
cargo test --test sqllogictests -- information_schema
```

```shell
# Automatically update ddl.slt with expected output
cargo test --test sqllogictests -- ddl --complete
```

```shell
# Run ddl.slt, printing debug logging to stdout
RUST_LOG=debug cargo test --test sqllogictests -- ddl
```

## Cookbook: Adding Tests

1. Add queries

Add the setup and queries you want to run to a `.slt` file
(`my_awesome_test.slt` in this example) using the following format:

```text
query
CREATE TABLE foo AS VALUES (1);

query
SELECT * from foo;
```

2. Fill in expected answers with `--complete` mode

Running the following command will update `my_awesome_test.slt` with the expected output:

```shell
cargo test --test sqllogictests -- my_awesome_test --complete
```

3. Verify the content

In the case above, `my_awesome_test.slt` will look something like

```
statement ok
CREATE TABLE foo AS VALUES (1);

query I
SELECT * from foo;
----
1
```

Assuming it looks good, check it in!

# Reference

## Running tests: Validation Mode

In this mode, `sqllogictests` runs the statements and queries in a `.slt` file, comparing the expected output in the
file to the output produced by that run.

For example, to run all tests suites in validation mode

```shell
cargo test --test sqllogictests
```

sqllogictests also supports `cargo test` style substring matches on file names to restrict which tests to run

```shell
# information_schema.slt matches due to substring matching `information`
cargo test --test sqllogictests -- information
```

## Running tests: Postgres compatibility

Test files that start with prefix `pg_compat_` verify compatibility
with Postgres by running the same script files both with DataFusion and with Postgres

In order to run the sqllogictests running against a previously running Postgres instance, do:

```shell
PG_COMPAT=true PG_URI="postgresql://postgres@127.0.0.1/postgres" cargo test --features=postgres --test sqllogictests
```

The environemnt variables:

1. `PG_COMPAT` instructs sqllogictest to run against Postgres (not DataFusion)
2. `PG_URI` contains a `libpq` style connection string, whose format is described in
   [the docs](https://docs.rs/tokio-postgres/latest/tokio_postgres/config/struct.Config.html#url)

One way to create a suitable a posgres container in docker is to use
the [Official Image](https://hub.docker.com/_/postgres) with a command
such as the following. Note the collation **must** be set to `C` otherwise
`ORDER BY` will not match DataFusion and the tests will diff.

```shell
docker run \
  -p5432:5432 \
  -e POSTGRES_INITDB_ARGS="--encoding=UTF-8 --lc-collate=C --lc-ctype=C" \
  -e POSTGRES_HOST_AUTH_METHOD=trust \
  postgres
```

## Running Tests: `tpch`

Test files in `tpch` directory runs against the `TPCH` data set (SF =
0.1), which must be generated before running. You can use following
command to generate tpch data, assuming you are in the repository
root:

```shell
mkdir -p datafusion/sqllogictest/test_files/tpch/data
docker run -it \
  -v "$(realpath datafusion/sqllogictest/test_files/tpch/data)":/data \
  ghcr.io/scalytics/tpch-docker:main -vf -s 0.1
```

Then you need to add `INCLUDE_TPCH=true` to run tpch tests:

```shell
INCLUDE_TPCH=true cargo test --test sqllogictests
```

## Updating tests: Completion Mode

In test script completion mode, `sqllogictests` reads a prototype script and runs the statements and queries against the
database engine. The output is a full script that is a copy of the prototype script with result inserted.

You can update the tests / generate expected output by passing the `--complete` argument.

```shell
# Update ddl.slt with output from running
cargo test --test sqllogictests -- ddl --complete
```

## Running tests: `scratchdir`

The DataFusion sqllogictest runner automatically creates a directory
named `test_files/scratch/<filename>`, creating it if needed and
clearing any file contents if it exists.

For example, the `test_files/copy.slt` file should use scratch
directory `test_files/scratch/copy`.

Tests that need to write temporary files should write (only) to this
directory to ensure they do not interfere with others concurrently
running tests.

## `.slt` file format

[`sqllogictest`] was originally written for SQLite to verify the
correctness of SQL queries against the SQLite engine. The format is designed
engine-agnostic and can parse sqllogictest files (`.slt`), runs
queries against an SQL engine and compares the output to the expected
output.

[`sqllogictest`]: https://www.sqlite.org/sqllogictest/doc/trunk/about.wiki

Tests in the `.slt` file are a sequence of query records generally
starting with `CREATE` statements to populate tables and then further
queries to test the populated data.

Each `.slt` file runs in its own, isolated `SessionContext`, to make the test setup explicit and so they can run in
parallel. Thus it important to keep the tests from having externally visible side effects (like writing to a global
location such as `/tmp/`)

Query records follow the format:

```sql
# <test_name>
query <type_string> <sort_mode>
<sql_query>
----
<expected_result>
```

- `test_name`: Uniquely identify the test name (Datafusion only)
- `type_string`: A short string that specifies the number of result columns and the expected datatype of each result
  column. There is one character in the <type_string> for each result column. The characters codes are:
  - 'B' - **B**oolean,
  - 'D' - **D**atetime,
  - 'I' - **I**nteger,
  - 'P' - timestam**P**,
  - 'R' - floating-point results,
  - 'T' - **T**ext,
  - "?" - any other types
- `expected_result`: In the results section, some values are converted according to some rules:
  - floating point values are rounded to the scale of "12",
  - NULL values are rendered as `NULL`,
  - empty strings are rendered as `(empty)`,
  - boolean values are rendered as `true`/`false`,
  - this list can be not exhaustive, check the `datafusion/sqllogictest/src/engines/conversion.rs` for
    details.
- `sort_mode`: If included, it must be one of `nosort` (**default**), `rowsort`, or `valuesort`. In `nosort` mode, the
  results appear in exactly the order in which they were received from the database engine. The `nosort` mode should
  only be used on queries that have an `ORDER BY` clause or which only have a single row of result, since otherwise the
  order of results is undefined and might vary from one database engine to another. The `rowsort` mode gathers all
  output from the database engine then sorts it by rows on the client side. Sort comparisons
  use [sort_unstable](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/primitive.slice.html#method.sort_unstable) on the rendered text
  representation of the values. Hence, "9" sorts after "10", not before. The `valuesort` mode works like `rowsort`
  except that it does not honor row groupings. Each individual result value is sorted on its own.

> :warning: It is encouraged to either apply `order by`, or use `rowsort` for queries without explicit `order by`
> clauses.

### Example

```sql
# group_by_distinct
query TTI
SELECT a, b, COUNT(DISTINCT c) FROM my_table GROUP BY a, b ORDER BY a, b
----
foo bar 10
foo baz 5
foo     4
        3
```
