## CTE Reference Resolution
##########

# These tests exercise CTE reference resolution with and without identifier
# normalization. The session is configured with a strict catalog/schema provider
# (see `datafusion/sqllogictest/src/test_context.rs`) that only provides the
# `orders` table and panics on any unexpected table lookup.
#
# This makes it observable if DataFusion incorrectly treats a CTE reference as a
# catalog lookup.
#
# Refs: https://github.com/apache/datafusion/issues/18932
#
# NOTE: This test relies on a strict catalog/schema provider registered in
# `datafusion/sqllogictest/src/test_context.rs` that provides only the `orders`
# table and panics on unexpected lookups.
