## Original Query: SELECT sign(40);
## PySpark 3.5.5 Result: {'sign(40)': 1.0, 'typeof(sign(40))': 'double', 'typeof(40)': 'int'}
#query
#SELECT sign(40::int);

## Original Query: SELECT sign(INTERVAL -'100' YEAR);
## PySpark 3.5.5 Result: {"sign(INTERVAL '-100' YEAR)": -1.0, "typeof(sign(INTERVAL '-100' YEAR))": 'double', "typeof(INTERVAL '-100' YEAR)": 'interval year'}
#query
#SELECT sign(INTERVAL '-100' YEAR::interval year);
