## SQL tests for CREATE / DROP FUNCTION
##
## Note that DataFusion provides a pluggable system for creating functions
## but has no built in support for doing so.

# Create function will fail unless a user supplied function factory is supplied
statement error DataFusion error: Invalid or Unsupported Configuration: Function factory has not been configured
CREATE FUNCTION foo (DOUBLE) RETURNS DOUBLE RETURN $1 + $2;

# multi-part identifiers are not supported
statement error DataFusion error: This feature is not implemented: Qualified functions are not supported
CREATE FUNCTION foo.bar (DOUBLE) RETURNS DOUBLE RETURN $1 + $2;

statement error DataFusion error: This feature is not implemented: Qualified functions are not supported
DROP FUNCTION foo.bar;

# Show it is possible to drop existing (UDF) functions
query I
select abs(-1);
----
1

# drop the function
statement ok
DROP FUNCTION abs;

# now the query errors
query error Invalid function 'abs'.
select abs(-1);

# Can't drop the function again
statement error DataFusion error: Execution error: Function does not exist
DROP FUNCTION abs;

# But DROP IF EXISTS does not error
statement ok
DROP FUNCTION IF EXISTS abs;
