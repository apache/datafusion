# Tests for ROLLUP/CUBE/GROUPING SETS with multiple partitions
#
# This tests the fix for https://github.com/apache/datafusion/issues/19849
# where ROLLUP queries produced incorrect results with multiple partitions
# because subset partitioning satisfaction was incorrectly applied.
#
# The bug manifests when:
# 1. UNION ALL of subqueries each with hash-partitioned aggregates
# 2. Outer ROLLUP groups by more columns than inner hash partitioning
# 3. InterleaveExec preserves the inner hash partitioning
# 4. Optimizer incorrectly uses subset satisfaction, skipping necessary repartition
#
# The fix ensures that when hash partitioning includes __grouping_id,
# subset satisfaction is disabled and proper RepartitionExec is inserted.

# TEST 1: UNION ALL + ROLLUP pattern (similar to TPC-DS q14)
# This query pattern triggers the subset satisfaction bug because:
# - Each UNION ALL branch has hash partitioning on (brand)
# - The outer ROLLUP requires hash partitioning on (channel, brand, __grouping_id)
# - Without the fix, subset satisfaction incorrectly skips repartition
