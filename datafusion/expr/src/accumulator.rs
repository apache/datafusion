/// `Accumulator`s are stateful objects that live throughout the
/// evaluation of multiple rows and aggregate multiple values together
/// into a final output aggregate.
///
/// An accumulator knows how to:
/// * update its state from inputs via [`update_batch`]
///
/// * compute the final value from its internal state via [`evaluate`]
///
/// * retract an update to its state from given inputs via
/// [`retract_batch`] (when used as a window aggregate [window
/// function])
///
/// * convert its internal state to a vector of aggregate values via
/// [`state`] and combine the state from multiple accumulators'
/// via [`merge_batch`], as part of efficient multi-phase grouping.
