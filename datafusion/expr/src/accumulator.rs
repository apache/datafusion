/// evaluation of multiple rows and aggregate multiple values together
/// into a final output aggregate.

/// An accumulator knows how to:
/// * update its state from inputs via `update_batch`
/// * (optionally) retract an update to its state from given inputs via `retract_batch`
/// * convert its internal state to a vector of aggregate values
/// * update its state from multiple accumulators' states via `merge_batch`
/// * compute the final value from its internal state via `evaluate`
