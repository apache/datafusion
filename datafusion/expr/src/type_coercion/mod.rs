//! Type coercion rules for DataFusion
//!
//! Coercion is performed automatically by DataFusion when the types
//! of arguments passed to a function or needed by operators do not
//! exacty match the types required by that function / operator. In
//! this case, DataFusion will attempt to *coerce* the arguments to
//! types accepted by the function by inserting CAST operations.
//!
//! CAST operations added by coercion are lossless and never discard
//! information.
//!
//! For example coercion from i32 -> i64 might be
//! performed because all valid i32 values can be represented using an
//! i64. However, i64 -> i32 is never performed as there are i64
//! values which can not be represented by i32 values.
