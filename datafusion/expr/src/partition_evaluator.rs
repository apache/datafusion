/// Partition evaluator for Window Functions
///
/// # Background
///
/// An implementation of this trait is created and used for each
/// partition defined by an `OVER` clause and is instantiated by
/// the DataFusion runtime.
///
/// For example, evaluating `window_func(val) OVER (PARTITION BY col)`
/// on the following data:
///
/// ```text
/// col | val
/// --- + ----
///  A  | 10
///  A  | 10
///  C  | 20
///  D  | 30
///  D  | 30
/// ```
///
/// Will instantiate three `PartitionEvaluator`s, one each for the
/// partitions defined by `col=A`, `col=B`, and `col=C`.
///
/// ```text
/// col | val
/// --- + ----
///  A  | 10     <--- partition 1
///  A  | 10
///
/// col | val
/// --- + ----
///  C  | 20     <--- partition 2
///
/// col | val
/// --- + ----
///  D  | 30     <--- partition 3
///  D  | 30
/// ```
///
/// Different methods on this trait will be called depending on the
/// capabilities described by [`supports_bounded_execution`],
/// [`uses_window_frame`], and [`include_rank`],
///
/// When implementing a new `PartitionEvaluator`, implement
/// corresponding evaluator according to table below.
